1.
thousands of fish killed after pemex
spill in el río salado and everyone
runs out to buy more bottled water.
here, our river kills more crossers
than the sun, than the singular
 
heat of arizona, than the ranchlands
near the falfurrias checkpoint.
it's hard to imagine an endangered
river with that much water, especially
in summer and with the falcon reservoir
 
in drought, though it only takes inches
to drown. sometimes, further
west, there's too little river
to paddle in boquillas canyon
where there are no steel-column walls
 
except the limestone canyon's drop
and where a puma might push-wade across,
or in el paso, where double-fenced muros
sparkle and blind with bullfight ring lights,
the ring the concrete river mold, and above
 
a juárez mountain urges
la biblia es la verdad—leela.
 
2.
today at the vigil, the native singer
said we are all connected
by water, la sangre de vida.
 
today, our vigil signs proclaimed
mcallen is not murrieta.
#iamborderless. derechos
inmigrantes=derechos
humanos. bienvenidos niños.
we stand with refugee children.
we are all human. bienvenidos
a los estados unidos.
 
and the songs we sang
the copal that burned
and the rose petals spread
en los cuatro puntos were
for the children and women
and men. songs
 
for the guatemalan
boy with an elvis belt buckle
and angry birds jeans with zippers
on back pockets who was found
shirtless in la joya, one mile
from the river. the worn jeans
 
that helped identify his body
in the news more times
than a photo of him while alive.
(i never knew why the birds
are angry. my mother said
someone stole their eggs.)
 
the tejas sun took a boy
i do not know, a young man
who wanted to reach chicago,
his brother's number etched in
his belt, his mother's pleas not
to leave in white rosary beads
 
he carried. the sun in tejas
stopped a boy the river held.
detention centers filled, churches
offer showers and fresh clothes.
water and a covered porch may
have waited at a stranger's house
 
or in a patrol truck had his body
not collapsed. half of our bodies
are made of water, and we can't
sponge rivers through skin
and release them again
like rain clouds. today
 
at the vigil the native singer
sang we are all connected
by water, la sangre de vida.
