sorrento, at night the long fingers of your orange lights
prick me in the sizzling streets, where the pinnacles
of other people ring tinny and papier-mâché. is this the way
up to the murderous cliff? it’s most important that i get there
and leave no witness. ah, is this the majolica medallion
which marks the grave of girl abducted by a stallion
whom she gave a lump of maple sugar?
                                                                               for that was in an autumn,
the time of year when young girls get hopeless and feel like
giving it all away, the way a matronly merchant
might brush off her lap, at the iron end of the market day:
it’s over, it’s worthless, without deserving and without
purpose have i nourished this hope in my small patch of earth,
a sickly weed whose nodding sun’s gone nova.
