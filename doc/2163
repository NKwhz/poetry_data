the trees are in their autumn beauty,
the woodland paths are dry,
under the october twilight the water
mirrors a still sky;
upon the brimming water among the stones
are nine-and-fifty swans.
the nineteenth autumn has come upon me
since i first made my count;
i saw, before i had well finished,
all suddenly mount
and scatter wheeling in great broken rings
upon their clamorous wings.
i have looked upon those brilliant creatures,
and now my heart is sore.
all's changed since i, hearing at twilight,
the first time on this shore,
the bell-beat of their wings above my head,
trod with a lighter tread.
unwearied still, lover by lover,
they paddle in the cold
companionable streams or climb the air;
their hearts have not grown old;
passion or conquest, wander where they will,
attend upon them still.
but now they drift on the still water,
mysterious, beautiful;
among what rushes will they build,
by what lake's edge or pool
delight men's eyes when i awake some day
to find they have flown away?
