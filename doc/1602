my last sabbath,
i follow the girls, who sneak into
the wedding
tent, scattered with sun
flower seeds and remnants of
celebration. they
each stand up on a   
table. take a crushed beer can
as a microphone,
sing and move their
fifteen-year-old hips. i watch,
clap for them, until
a small face peers in
the door. a boy. his face white
with something. the door
slamming, his very small
fist holding it shut, having
found what was inside
wrong. enough, i tell
him; enough! he leaves. the girls
dance again, but less
bold. look: the boy
has come back, is looking you
hard in the eye, through
the crack of the door.
there, in his hand, a neon
plastic bb
gun. he does this for
his grandmother and for his
son.
