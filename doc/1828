love has crept into her sealed heart
as a field bee, black and amber,
breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber
up the warm grass where the sunbeams start.
love has crept into her summery eyes,
and a glint of colored sunshine brings
such as his along the folded wings
of the bee before he flies.
but i with my ruffling, impatient breath
have loosened the wings of the wild young sprite;
he has opened them out in a reeling flight,
and down her words he hasteneth.
love flies delighted in her voice:
the hum of his glittering, drunken wings
sets quivering with music the little things
that she says, and her simple words rejoice.
