bewildered saint of the curse, bulbous
& profane, i invoke you against this nest
of lice & vipers: o volcanic captain, i implore you, pour
your scorn upon these borgias; before these braggarts
unfurl your thick invective, show your bullet head
whiskey-pickled, weathered & pupilless, sweating
in a bantam rage, your sad-fish face a fist;
ostrogothic versus the matrons
voluble against the vampireâ€™s slander
because i would never say vivisectionist to her face
while you old captain fatstock, hopscotch, havoc
denouncer of bullies, knitters & bandits
live to make the air around you frantic
to spill your black lake of cannibal ink.
