i should be happy with my lot:
a wife and mother – is it not
enough for me to be content?
what other blessing could be sent?
a quiet house, and homely ways,
that make each day like other days;
i only see time’s shadow now
darken the hair on baby’s brow!
no world’s work ever comes to me,
no beggar brings his misery;
i have no power, no healing art
with bruised soul or broken heart.
i read the poets of the age,
’tis lotus-eating in a cage;
i study art, but art is dead
to one who clamors to be fed
with milk from nature’s rugged breast,
who longs for labor’s lusty rest.
o foolish wish! i still should pine
if any other lot were mine.
