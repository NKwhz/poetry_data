my sweet did sweetly sleep,
and on her rosy face
stood tears of pearl, which beauty’s self did weep;
i, wond’ring at her grace,
did all amaz’d remain,
when love said, “fool, can looks thy wishes crown?
time past comes not again.”
then did i me bow down,
and kissing her fair breast, lips, cheeks, and eyes
prov’d here on earth the joys of paradise.
