what a saint you are, shining on everything,
drawn to the world like flames are to moths,
like honey to bees. so readily do you dole
yourself out, and in such abundance so that
we might operate our otherwise redundant eyes.
for they’d be useless even as shiny bibelots
that studded the otherwise dull surfaces of faces.
no, in your absence, in that total darkness
the eyes wouldn’t see or even be seen. and they
would soon shrivel up and desiccate, die out
from pointlessness like the little toe will
(unless we can find a way to reverse its long
decline). hey, plump eyes! isn’t it time you put
your tiny wet hands together for the light!
