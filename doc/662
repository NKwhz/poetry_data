please think of this as not merely a piece
of writing that anyone would fully
appreciate, but as plain and simple
words that attempt to arouse whatever
appetencies you, especially, depend
upon language to fulfill; that drench you
in several levels of meaning at once,
rendering my presence superfluous.
in other words, welcome this as a poem,
not merely a missive i’ve slowly composed
and tucked under your windshield wiper
so that these onlookers who saw me bash
in your fender will think i’m jotting down
the usual information and go away.
