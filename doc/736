                          i
            phantasmal fears,
            and the flap of the flame,
            and the throb of the clock,
            and a loosened slate,
            and the blind night's drone,
which tiredly the spectral pines intone!
                          ii
            and the blood in my ears
            strumming always the same,
            and the gable-cock
            with its fitful grate,
            and myself, alone.
                         iii
            the twelfth hour nears
            hand-hid, as in shame;
            i undo the lock,
            and listen, and wait
            for the young unknown.
                         iv
            in the dark there careers — 
            as if death astride came
            to numb all with his knock — 
            a horse at mad rate
            over rut and stone.
                         v
            no figure appears,
            no call of my name,
            no sound but 'tic-toc'
            without check. past the gate
            it clatters — is gone.
                         vi
            what rider it bears
            there is none to proclaim;
            and the old year has struck,
            and, scarce animate,
            the new makes moan.
                         vii
            maybe that 'more tears! — 
            more famine and flame — 
            more severance and shock!'
            is the order from fate
            that the rider speeds on
to pale europe; and tiredly the pines intone.
