one day, you will awake from your covering
and that heart of yours will be totally mended,
and there will be no more burning within.
the owl, calling in the setting of the sun
and the deer path, all erased.
and there will be no more need for love
or lovers or fears of losing lovers
and there will be no more burning timbers
with which to light a new fire,
and there will be no more husbands or people
related to husbands, and there will be no more
tears or reason to shed your tears.
you will be as mended as the bridge
the working crew has just reopened.
the thick air will be vanquished with the tide
and the river that was corrupted by lies
will be cleansed and totally free.
and the rooster will call in the setting sun
and the sun will beckon homeward,
hiding behind your one tree that was not felled.
