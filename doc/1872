my love? alas! i must not call you mine,
but to your envy’d bride that name resign:
i must forget your lovely melting charms,
and be for ever banisht from your arms:
for ever? oh! the horror of that sound!
it gives my bleeding heart a deadly wound:
while i might hope, although my hope was vain,
it gave some ease to my unpitty’d pain,
but now your hymen doth all hope exclude,
and but to think is sin; yet you intrude
on every thought; if i but close my eyes,
methinks your pleasing form besides me lies;
with every sigh i gently breath your name,
yet no ill thoughts pollute my hallow’d flame;
’tis pure and harmless, as a lambent fire,
and never mingled with a warm desire:
all i have now to ask of bounteous heaven,
is, that your perjuries may be forgiven:
that she who you have with your nuptials blest,
as she’s the happiest wife, may prove the best:
that all our joys may light on you alone,
then i can be contented to have none:
and never wish that you shou’d kinder be,
than now and then, to cast a thought on me:
and, madam, though the conquest you have won,
over my strephon, has my hopes undone;
i’le daily beg of heaven, he may be
kinder to you, than he has been to me.
