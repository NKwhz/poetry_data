in my mouth is as fat as a cow’s tongue,
still i want to ask the woman
at the next table what she’s saying
into her phone. a tongue, a cow’s tongue
tastes like the rest of the cow. cow tastes like
cow, an aunt once said in an accent as sweet
as arkansas dirt. someone, in english, told me
i don’t carry my vowels like anyone
they know. i’ve tried, but my tongue won’t move
like my aunt’s nor like anyone else’s
in my family. i ain’t makin’ sense, they’d say
if they were me. why don’t i talk
like us anymore? anyway    ...    every other word,
the woman slips into english. the way a train window
trades a dead city for a dead suburb;
a posh row for a cow pasture. duct cleaning, thai bistro,
all i can make out. i happen to love thai bistro,
raved about it to a friend — who’s never lived
in the city or eaten thai food. he asked,
how do you know you’re not eating the tongue
of some endangered animal? i have the tongue
of some endangered animal. no one can understand me
anymore. i’m the animal on my plate
that eventually mumbles in my stomach. speak up!
what are you saying?! i shout to the woman
with my inside voice. oh well    ...    a tongue
is a tongue is a tongue. i bet
the woman is talking about the weather;
or what she needs to pick up from the store;
or what to get __ for __’s birthday;
or __ said __ is coming to __ ;
or __ __ __ __ .
