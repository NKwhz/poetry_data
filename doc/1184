the orbiting reflector
turns night into day: petals ping
 
accelerated workers 
         swarm into the plaza
a blur on the soulâ€™s dead instrument
 
everywhere, windows are blanked
to the same newsreel
 
i alone
inhabit a mockup of the early nineteenth century
 
i, the great idealist
         who confesses
on the first page of his diary: father!
there are no living atoms
 
& the diary answers: identity
is that
which is eaten from within
 
another man is partially assembled
on the table
 
another module
unshrouded, revolves in sunlight
 
         filtered through noise
a simulated victory
 
crawls like a glove
animated by music
