a fourth was needed so one of the three
invited a friend and i came along as a spare
in case a chair was empty since i could fill
in as easily as i could shout out a rhyme.
as the jive flowed like the river jordan
and joshua and his trumpets sounded the alarm
the winning cards slam damned on the table
and i laughed along with morning noon and night.
my three big brothers: bold smart handsome.
one slim as a stick of dynamite, the second solid
as a line backer and the third crazy enough
to fight them both if they let it roll beyond talk.
treated me like a child even after i had my first.
the three of them (ace king and a wild card)
improbably born within four years as if daddy
and momma were trying to break a record
or win a bet about how many diapers a woman
could change in a single day without cursing
the hand god had dealt her; the odds were even
until i came along years later to tell their story.
