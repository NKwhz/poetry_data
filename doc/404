my doctor's packed the place for years
because he's known for making huge things
sometimes disappear. his routine is predictable,
effortless. pick a number, any number: he's pointing
to his framed pain scale. he pauses for effect.
the six second sequenced faces are a kid—time-lapsed—
at a magic show gone wrong. onstage in vegas
once, the rare white tiger snapped. inexplicable:
my numbers creeping up each week. my doctor
backs out quickly, as if dragged off in some beast's jaws.
