it’s dark in here, the dark inside of a man
in the dark. it’s not night. one hears crows
overhead, dawn fowl caws, the shod soles again
treading their sunlit plots above. one grows
dotish-fond of such things. long live the things,
their ways, their roots pushed goatish & gray
through the skull, in this earth that gaily spins
though one has crossed its smutted green threshold
to reign in a crate. we have done no wrong,
my friends, & yet we find ourselves soiled,
sold, carbonized teeth in a moss-riven jaw.
once i sat on a stool as my grandmother told
me of heaven. she cleaned fish for our living. i saw
how her rusty black knife unseamed the sunset
in each belly—coral, ochre, carmine, raw,
lice-infested sunsets in a pail. so many nights.
night in the kitchen shack, night at the crumbling edge
of our milk-pond province, a blade, lone cricket
raving in the lawn.
