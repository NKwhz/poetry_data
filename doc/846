there are rooftops
made of cloud remnants
gathered by a trader
dabbling in car parts and burlap
at night, i dive onto the breeze
fermenting above the dirt
and dream that i am a crocodile
a tin of shoe polish, an audience of two
in the morning, before the smallest yawn
becomes a noodle, i am offered
a ribbon of yellow smoke
i opt for fuzzy rocks and clawed water
and, of course, the perishable window
i am one of the last computer
chain errors to be illuminated
i tell you there are rooftops
on which the moon stops
being a cold jewel
and one by one the mountains
begin their descent from
the chambers of a lost book
