cherub-bee-dee how does a man
who doesn’t read english well know that cherub-bee-dum
those aren’t really words-bee-dee.
but birds.
cherub-bee-dum, he stumbles, reading to me
by the sliding glass door cherub-bee-dee, through which i watch
my brother play in the dum-dum-yard.
cherub-bee-dee, cherub-bee-dum, like how my father says
fine then! leave! my mother shouts, stupid! dumb!
we live in a small bee-dee-nest too, one hallway to bee-dum-slam doors.
birds? what are birds?
thanks to my father, reading with me, i have more feathers.
t-h-e. first word he ever taught me to pluck    ...
it is a word used all the time. cherub-cherub-bee-dum!
the mail. the mailbox. the school bus. the the.
he asks me to read the mail. not birds, mail.
if you don’t read this, you will turn into birds.
and i read it to him the best i can.
the end. a feather. two feathers. the. the end.
mother, mother. repeat after me.
cherub-bee-dee, cherub-bee-dum!
we read together before bedtime.
