the victorious army marches into the city,
& not far behind tarries a throng of women
who slept with the enemy on the edge
of battlements. the stunned morning
opens into a dust cloud of hooves
& drums. some new priests cradle
stone tablets, & others are poised
with raised mallets in a forest of defeated
statuary. of course, behind them
linger the turncoats & pious
merchants of lime. what’s greek
is forged into roman; what’s roman
is hammered into a ceremony of birds
headed east. whatever is marble
burns in the lime kilns because
someone dreams of a domed bathhouse.
