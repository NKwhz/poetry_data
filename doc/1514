the night you died, i dreamed you came to camp
to hear confession from an eagle scout
tortured by forty years of sin and doubt.
you whispered vespers by a hissing lamp.
handlers, allowing you to hike with me,
followed us to the bad axe waterfront
down a ﬁrebreak this camper used to hunt.
through all i said you suffered silently.
i blamed the authors of my unbelief:
st. paul, who would have deemed my love obscene,
the jesuit who raped me as a teen,
the altar boy when i was six, the grief
of a child chucked from eden, left for dead
by peter’s church and all the choirs above.
in a thick polish accent choked with love,
te dominus amat was all you said.
