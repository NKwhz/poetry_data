the best game the fairies play,
    the best game of all,
is sliding down steeples—
    (you know they’re very tall).
you fly to the weathercock,
    and when you hear it crow,
you fold your wings and clutch your things
    and then let go!
they have a million other games—
    cloud-catching’s one,
and mud-mixing after rain
    is heaps and heaps of fun;
but when you go and stay with them
    never mind the rest,
take my advice—they’re very nice,
    but steeple-sliding’s best!
