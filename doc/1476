men who have hardly uncurled
from their posture in the
womb. naked. heads bowed, not
in prayer, but in contemplation
of the earth they came from,
that suckled them on the brown
milk that builds bone not brain.
who called them forth to walk
in the green light, their thoughts
on darkness? their women,
who are not madonnas, have babes
at the breast with the wise,
time-ridden faces of the christ
child in a painting by a florentine
master. the warriors prepare poison
with loveâ€™s care for the sebastians
of their arrows. they have no
god, but follow the contradictions
of a ritual that says
life must die that life
may go on. they wear flowers in their hair.
