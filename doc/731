                         i
when moiling seems at cease
       in the vague void of night-time,
       and heaven's wide roomage stormless
       between the dusk and light-time,
       and fear at last is formless,
we call the allurement peace.
                         ii
peace, this hid riot, change,
       this revel of quick-cued mumming,
       this never truly being,
       this evermore becoming,
       this spinner's wheel onfleeing
outside perception's range.
