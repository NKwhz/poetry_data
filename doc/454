untitled, from the silueta series, 1980, by ana mendieta
has appeared to the mountain
dwellers, her grief  engraved
where stone softens to clay. keep
your eyes sharp for a dagger.
in its hilt, you’ll find her face
pressed to the earth’s cheek. kiss
this sacred spot before the rains
wash it away like her orphaned
feet. notched heart cradles
a planet heavy with night-
mares flying into empty mouths.
listen for their thirsty murmurs.
she’ll push her ponderous child
into the dew of  a san felipe dawn,
name him salvador. they’ll rest
beneath a web spun umbilical,
eclipsed from our human eyes.
