it's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers.
there is only this sound of falling, quiet and remote,
like the memory of scales descending the white keys
of a childhood pianoâ€”outside the window, palms!
and the heavy head of the cereus, inclining,
soon to let down its white or yellow-white.
now, only these poor snow-flowers in a heap,
like the memory of a white dress cast down . . .
so much has fallen.
                                    and i, who have listened for a step
all afternoon, hear it now, but already falling away,
already in memory. and the terrible scales descending
on the silent piano; the snow; and the absent flowers
      abounding.
