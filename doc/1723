the yolk went down my leg
like a beautiful snail without a shell,
went down the hill
to the skillet of water, to the nymphflies,
into the lips of pond minnows,
down the long belly of the gar â€“ the hellbenders
having dived and lost, then into
the paw of the lame panther
who loped back to her lair with it.
as for the white, it stayed with me,
mark of the beast, birth, and trade.
