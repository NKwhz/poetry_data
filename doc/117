i want to always sleep beneath a bright red blanket
of leaves. i want to never wear a coat of ice.
i want to learn to walk without blinking.
 
i want to outlive the turtle and the turtle’s father,
the stone. i want a mouth full of permissions
 
and a pink glistening bud. if the wildflower and ant hill
can return after sleeping each season, i want to walk
out of this house wearing nothing but wind.
 
i want to greet you, i want to wait for the bus with you
weighing less than a chill. i want to fight off the bolts
 
of gray lighting the alcoves and winding paths
of your hair. i want to fight off the damp nudgings
of snow. i want to fight off the wind.
 
i want to be the wind and i want to fight off the wind
with its sagging banner of isolation, its swinging
 
screen doors, its gilded boxes, and neatly folded pamphlets
of noise. i want to fight off the dull straight lines
of two by fours and endings, your disapprovals,
 
your doubts and regulations, your carbon copies.
if the locust can abandon its suit,
 
i want a brand new name. i want the pepper’s fury
and the salt’s tenderness. i want the virtue
of the evening rain, but not its gossip.
 
i want the moon’s intuition, but not its questions.
i want the malice of nothing on earth. i want to enter
 
every room in a strange electrified city
and find you there. i want your lips around the bell of flesh
 
at the bottom of my ear. i want to be the mirror,    
but not the nightstand. i do not want to be the light switch.
i do not want to be the yellow photograph
 
or book of poems. when i leave this body, woman,
i want to be pure flame. i want to be your song.
