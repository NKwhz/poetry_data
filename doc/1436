i wake up cold, i who
prospered through dreams of heat   
wake to their residue,   
sweat, and a clinging sheet.   
my flesh was its own shield:   
where it was gashed, it healed.
i grew as i explored   
the body i could trust   
even while i adored
the risk that made robust,
a world of wonders in
each challenge to the skin.
i cannot but be sorry
the given shield was cracked,
my mind reduced to hurry,   
my flesh reduced and wrecked.
i have to change the bed,   
but catch myself instead
stopped upright where i am   
hugging my body to me   
as if to shield it from   
the pains that will go through me,
         
as if hands were enough   
to hold an avalanche off.
