yes, i was jealous when you threw the glass.
i wanted the shattering against the wood-paneled floor for myself,
to be the sudden diaspora of its pieces across the apartment — and last night
when we fought, i wanted you to hit me so badly i begged.
and the other day walking past renewal-on-the-bowery,
when one of the men smoking unsteadily outside
called me a faggot, i thought: good. people get what they deserve.
then i wished i were more like jesus — capable of loving
all people and all things always, capable of nothing
but love. i waste half my wishes this way,
wishing to be virtuous. the rest, well,
i don’t have to tell you, do i?
