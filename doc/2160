mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost
with the least shade of thought to sin allied.
woman! above all women glorified,
our tainted nature's solitary boast;
purer than foam on central ocean tost;
brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn
with fancied roses, than the unblemished moon
before her wane begins on heaven's blue coast;
thy image falls to earth. yet some, i ween,
not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,
as to a visible power, in which did blend
all that was mixed and reconciled in thee
of mother's love with maiden purity,
of high with low, celestial with terrene!
