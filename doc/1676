the star dissolved in evening—the one star
the silently
                   and night o soon now, soon
and still the light now
                                    and still now the large
relinquishing
                     and through the pools of blue
still, still the swallows
                                       and a wind now
                                                            and the tree
gathering darkness:
                              i was small. i lay
beside my mother on the grass, and sleep
came—
          slow hooves and dripping with the dark
the velvet muzzles, the white feet that move
in a dream water
                        and o soon now soon
sleep and the night.
                              and i was not afraid.
her hand lay over mine. her fingers knew
darkness,—and sleep—the silent lands, the far
far off of morning where i should awake.
