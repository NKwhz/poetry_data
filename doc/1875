into the changes of autumn brush
the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears
were the tinsel browns. they made her.
i could not see her. she reappeared, stuffed with apples,
and i shot her. into the pines she ran,
and i ran after. i might have lost her,
seeing no sign of blood or scuffle,
but felt myself part of the woods,
a woman with a doeâ€™s ears, and heard her
dying, counted her last breaths like a song
of dying, and found her dying.
i shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets,
then poked her with the gun barrel
because her eyes were dusty and unreal.
i opened her belly and pushed the insides
like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole,
skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee,
took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell
that was herself. ah, i closed her eyes.
i left her refolded in some briars
with the last sun on her head
like a benediction, head tilted on its axis
of neck and barren bone; head bent
wordless over a death, though i heard
the night wind blowing through her fur,
heard riot in the emptied head.
