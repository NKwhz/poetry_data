someone spoke to me last night,
told me the truth. just a few words,
but i recognized it.
i knew i should make myself get up,
write it down, but it was late,
and i was exhausted from working
all day in the garden, moving rocks.
now, i remember only the flavor —
not like food, sweet or sharp.
more like a fine powder, like dust.
and i wasn’﻿t elated or frightened,
but simply rapt, aware.
that’﻿s how it is sometimes —
god comes to your window,
all bright light and black wings,
and you’﻿re just too tired to open it.
