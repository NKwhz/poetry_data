torn turned and tattered
bowed burned and battered
i took untensed time by the teeth
and bade it bear me banking
out over the walled welter
                                           cities and the sea
through the lightsmocked birdpocked cloudcocked sky
to leave me light on a lilting planetesimal.
the stone walls wailed and whimpered
the bold stars paled and dimpled
godgone time gathered to a grunt
and bore me bled and breaking
on past parted palisades
                                           windrows and the trees
over a windcloaked nightsoaked starpoked sea
to drop me where? deep in a decadentâ€™s dream.
