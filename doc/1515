"myrtle loves harry"â€”it is sometimes hard to remember a thing like that,
hard to think about it, and no one knows what to do with it when he has it,
so write it out on a billboard that stands under the yellow light of an "l" platform among popcorn wrappers and crushed cigars,
a poster that says "mama i love crispy wafers so."
leave it on a placard where somebody else gave the blonde lady a pencil moustache, and another perplexed citizen deposited:
"jesus saves. jesus saves."
one can lay this bundle down there with the others,
and never lose it, or forget it, or want it.
"myrtle loves harry."
they live somewhere.
