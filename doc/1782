beside the rivers of the midnight town
where four-foot couples love and paupers drown,
shots of quick hell we took, our final kiss,
the great and swinging bridge a bower for this.
your cheek lay burning in my fingers’ cup;
often my lip moved downward and yours up
till both adjusted, tightened, locksmith-true:
the flesh precise, the crazy brain askew.
roughly the train with grim and piston knee
pounded apart our pleasure, you from me;
flare warned and ticket whispered and bell cried.
time and the locks of bitter rail divide.
for ease remember, all that parted lie:
men who in camp of shot or doldrum die,
who at land’s-end eternal furlough take
—this for memento as alone you wake.
