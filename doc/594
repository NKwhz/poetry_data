hand me this hand
the sail is bent
the trail is sold
and the wind tied in knots
answer the phone
the tune is left
the stones uncoil
in a wide-angle lens
a search for clues
encounters bliss
a lip on the edge
of the flowering dark
a shell falls with hail
hidden and hides
the following sky
the descending kiss.
