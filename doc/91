i give thee the sun as guarantee
and the egyptian faience beads
and the little silver oar that was gifted once
to an english harbor master.
i give thee the silk dress
with its triple-ruffled sleeves and
the cloaks with big hoods that fall full
though some are pulled in at a central button.
i give thee the little colored goats
that go down on their knees as penitents.
i give thee the death mask
and the plaster hand of seán ó riada,
for he is among the best loved of the musicians.
