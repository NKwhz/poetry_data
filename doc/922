i have tried to say
that, although love is not judgement
analysis too is a style
of affect
since the scale that rends me vulnerable
has cut, from abundance, doubt
(not that identity shunts
civic ratio or consequence) sure —
i would prefer to respond to only
the established charms (and forget inconvenience)
but her hair was also a kind of honey
or instrument.
 
all that is beautiful, from which i choose
even artifice, which i hold above nature
won’t salve these stuttered accoutrements
