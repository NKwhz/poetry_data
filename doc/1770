beginning to dangle beneath
the wind that blows from the undermined wood,   
      i feel the great pulley grind,
      the thread i cling to lengthen   
and let me soaring and spinning down into marble,
      hooked and weightlessly happy
      where the squared sun shines
back equally from all four sides, out of stone   
      and years of dazzling labor,
      to land at last among men
who cut with power saws a parian whiteness
      and, chewing slow tobacco,
      their eyebrows like frost,
shunt house-sized blocks and lash them to cables   
      and send them heavenward
      into small-town banks,
into the columns and statues of government buildings,   
      but mostly graves.
      i mount my monument and rise
slowly and spinningly from the white-gloved men   
      toward the hewn sky
      out of the basement of light,
sadly, lifted through timeâ€™s blinding layers   
      on perhaps my tombstone
      in which the original shape
michelangelo believed was in every rock upon earth   
      is heavily stirring,
      surprised to be an angel,
to be waked in north georgia by the ponderous play   
      of men with ten-ton blocks
      but no more surprised than i
to feel sadness fall off as though i myself   
      were rising from stone
      held by a thread in midair,
badly cut, local-looking, and totally uninspired,   
      not a masterwork
      or even worth seeing at all
but the spirit of this place just the same,   
      felt here as joy.
