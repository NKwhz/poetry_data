my son lives on the streets.
we don’t see each other much.
like a mother who puts white lilies
on the headstone of a dead child,
i put money into his bank account,
clothes into e-z access storage
and pretend he’s far away—
at a boarding school, or in a foreign country.
nights, i dream fairy tales about him.
i dream he becomes a prince,
scholar or warrior who rescues me
from sorrow, the way he rescued me
when he was a child and said,
“mommy, don’t cry,” and brought tea
into the room of his father’s acrimony—
brave, standing tall in the forest
fire of his father’s scorn. i wake
to the empty sound of wind in the trees.
he says he wants to live with me.
i say i can’t live with him—
boy whose words crash like branches in a rain storm.
nothing can hold him in,
the walls of a house too thin.
back home, i had seen
the “study-hard-so-you-don’t-become-like-them”
street bums on mamo street,
and he’s like them.
these days, in order to catch a glimpse of him,
i circle the city. one day,
i see him on his bike.
people give him wide berth,
the same way birds avoid power lines,
oncoming cars or trees.
i park on a side street.
wild-eyed, he flies the block
as if in a holding pattern.
not of my body, not of my hopes,
he homes in on what can’t be given or taken away.
