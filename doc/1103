i am saying primroses lined the pathway of toothless hedges.
i am saying the ocean shimmered like corrugated steel in the
morning sun.
the context of my story changes when you enter. then i am dung
on the wall of the nomad’﻿s field. then the everyday waking person.
i am nodding in your direction like fissures between dandelion fur.
seeing in your manner.
i am speaking your pace. slippage of silk slippers.
i say you are losing sight. i say your breasts are dry shells.
i am afraid of what i am capable of doing.
this is all a manner of stating how i prepare myself to be loved.
