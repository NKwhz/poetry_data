in the aftermath of calculus
your toast fell butter-side down.
squirrels swarmed the lawns
in flight patterns. the hovercraft
helped the waves along. from
every corner there was perspective.
on the billboards the diamonds
were real, in the stores, only zirconia.
i cc’ed you. i let you know.
sat down to write the black ice memo.
dinner would be meager &
reminiscent of next week’s lunch.
so what if i sat on the sectional?
as always i was beside myself.
