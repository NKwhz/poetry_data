brown. brandy-brown. leaf-brown. russet.
malayan yellow.
express train berlin-trelleborg and the baltic resorts.
flesh that went naked.
tanned unto the mouth by the sea.
deeply ripened for grecian joys.
how far along the summer, in sickle-submissiveness!
penultimate day of the ninth month!
parched with stubble and the last corn-shocks.
unfurlings, blood, fatigue,
deranged by dahlia-nearness.
man-brown jumps on woman-brown.
a woman is something for a night.
and if you enjoyed it, then the next one too!
o! and then the return to one’s own care.
the not-speaking! the urges!
a woman is something with a smell.
ineffable! to die for! mignonette.
shepherd, sea, and south.
on every declivity a bliss.
woman-brown drapes itself on man-brown:
hold me! i’m falling!
my neck is so weary.
oh, the sweet last
fevered scent from the gardens.
