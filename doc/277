strand. string.
in this dream,
the paths cross
and cross again.
they are spelling
a real boy
out of repetition.
 
•
each one
is the one
real boy.
each knows
he must be
wrong
about this, but
he can’t feel
how.
  •
the fish
and the fisherman,
the pilot,
the princess,
the fireman and
the ones on fire.
