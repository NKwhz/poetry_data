the hour like a child runs down the angle of star and rests at the bottom
it is a strange woman that may hold that child in its arms
but women prefer to see the hours slip from their fingers
for they are dancing an old earth constituency
i am a little beyond the river and stare from my particular casement
i am slender as the stalk and have my own flowering
i donâ€™t draw from women but i prefer the truth and not the trick of living
therefore i walk by women as the sea ponders by the shore
i tremble and splash my spray by the cavern
hear my own strange breath and laughter
but is my echoing and i am unalterably the sea.
