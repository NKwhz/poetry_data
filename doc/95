end of the day. a bar where you ought to leave a tip.
the green bird was saying pretty pretty pretty,
loved ones were walking home across the city.
i waved at the girl who waves her whip    ...
but please be certain i’m a citizen    ...
i take stuff to the dump    ...    or maybe it’s the tip?
i’m where the nitty really meets the gritty.
i know i find it hard to listen.
i read too much. i often need a drink.
it isn’t the world that makes us think,
it’s words that we can’t come up with.
sure, i can work up fresh examples
and send them off to the committee.
but the poetry is in the bird. and in the pretty.
