i saw an eagle sweep to the sky—
the godlike! – seeking his place on high,
with a strong, and wild, and rapid wing—
a dark, and yet a dazzling thing;
and his arching neck, his bristling crest,
and the dark plumes quivering upon his breast;
and his eye, bent up to each beam of light,
like a bright sword flash’d with a sword in fight.
i saw him rise o’er the forest trees;
i saw his pinion ride the breeze;
beyond the clouds i watched him tower
on his path of pride – his flight of power.
i watched him wheeling, stern and lone,
where the keenest ray of the sun was thrown;
soaring, circling – bathed in light:
such was that desert eagle’s flight.
suddenly, then, to my straining eye,
i saw the strong wing slack on high;
falling, falling to earth once more;
the dark breast covered with foam and gore;
the dark eyes’ glory dim with pain;
sick to death with a sun-struck brain!
reeling down from that height divine,
eagle of heaven! such fall was thine!
even so we see the sons of light,
up to the day-beam steer their flight;
and the wing of genius cleaves the sky,
as the clouds rush on when the winds are high:
then comes the hour of sudden dread— 
then is the blasting sunlight shed;
and the gifted fall in their agony,
sund-struck eagle! to die like thee!
