i was always leaving, i was
about to get up and go, i was
on my way, not sure where.
somewhere else. not here.
nothing here was good enough.
it would be better there, where i
was going. not sure how or why.
the dome i cowered under
would be raised, and i would be released
into my true life. i would meet there
the ones i was destined to meet.   
they would make an opening for me
among the flutes and boulders,
and i would be taken up. that this
might be a form of death
did not occur to me. i only know
that something held me back,
a doubt, a debt, a face i could not
leave behind. when the door
fell open, i did not go through.
