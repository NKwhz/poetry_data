a fool i was to sleep at noon,
and wake when night is chilly
beneath the comfortless cold moon;
a fool to pluck my rose too soon,
a fool to snap my lily.
my garden-plot i have not kept;
faded and all-forsaken,
i weep as i have never wept:
oh it was summer when i slept,
it's winter now i waken.
talk what you please of future spring
and sun-warm'd sweet to-morrow:â€”
stripp'd bare of hope and everything,
no more to laugh, no more to sing,
i sit alone with sorrow.
