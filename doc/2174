the spider expects the cold of winter.
when the shadows fall in long autumn
he congeals in a nest of paper, prepares
the least and minimal existence,
obedient to nature. no other course
is his; no other availed him when
in high summer he spun and furled
the gaudy catches. i am that spider,
caught in nature, summer and winter.
you are the symbol of the seasons too.

now to expatiate and temporize
this artful brag. i never saw so quieting
a sight as the dawn, dew-clenched foot-
wide web hung on summer barn-eaves, spangled.
it moves to zephyrs that is tough as steel.
i never saw so finely-legged a creature
walk so accurate a stretch as he,
proud, capable, patient, confident.
to the eye he gave close penetration
into real myth, the myth of you, of me.
  iii
yet, by moving eyesight off from this
there is another dimension. near the barn,
down meadow to shingle, no place for spiders,
the sea in large blue breathes in brainstorm tides,
pirates itself away to ancient spain,
pirouettes past purgatory to paradise.
do i feed deeper on a spider,
a close-hauled view upon windless meaning,
or deeper a day or dance or doom bestride
on oceanâ€™s long reach, on parables of god?
