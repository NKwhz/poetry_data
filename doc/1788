we’re all dreamers; we don’t know who we are.
some machine made us; machine of the world, the constricting family.
then back to the world, polished by soft whips.
we dream; we don’t remember.
machine of the family: dark fur, forests of the mother’s body.
machine of the mother: white city inside her.
and before that: earth and water.
moss between rocks, pieces of leaves and grass.
and before, cells in a great darkness.
and before that, the veiled world.
this is why you were born: to silence me.
cells of my mother and father, it is your turn
to be pivotal, to be the masterpiece.
i improvised; i never remembered.
now it’s your turn to be driven;
you’re the one who demands to know:
why do i suffer? why am i ignorant?
cells in a great darkness. some machine made us;
it is your turn to address it, to go back asking
what am i for? what am i for?
