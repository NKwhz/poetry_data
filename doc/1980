my uncle fletcher,
our county seer,
bestowed his gifts
on my no-good cousin jeff,
who had a feeling
about nearly everything.
"that guy of hers . . ."
"those fucking queers . . ."
he'd say, giving me the eye,
which was the same eye
that could gaze upon
a yellow froth of newborns,
and know the cockerels
from the pullets.
