of tribulation, these are they,
denoted by the white.
— emily dickinson
pained, permanent
wakefulness
exposed
in the split geode
a santa’s grotto
jagged milk
quartz crusts
constitute
every surface —
a mouth
all teeth
self-sharpening
like sea urchins’ —
“uncomfortably beautiful”
toughened glass
spikes
in the doorways
of award-
winning offices
— rough
sleepers from the womb
condemned
to make of anything succulent
rock
of porticoes
iron maidens
