columns, arches, vaults: how he knew
the ways you promise what you lack;
and that your bodies, like your souls,
always slip from our grasping hands.
space is such a lure . . . swift to disappoint,
as they raise and topple clouds, the sky's
architects still offer more than ours,
who only build a scaffolding of dreams.
he dreamed, all the same; but on that day,
he gave a better use to beauty's shapes:
he understood that form means to die.
and this, his final work, is a coin
with both sides bare. he made in stone,
of this great room, the arrow and the bow.
