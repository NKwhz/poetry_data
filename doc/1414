on summer nights i sleep naked
in jerusalem. my bed
stands on the brink of a deep valley
without rolling down into it.
in the daytime i walk around with the ten
commandments on my lips
like an old tune someone hums to himself.
oh touch me, touch me, good woman!
that’s not a scar you feel under my shirt, that’s
a letter of recommendation, folded up tight,
from my father:
“all the same, he’s a good boy, and full of love.”
i remember my father waking me for early prayers.
he would do it by gently stroking my forehead, not
by tearing away the blanket.
since then i love him even more.
and as his reward, may he be wakened
gently and with love
on the day of the resurrection.
