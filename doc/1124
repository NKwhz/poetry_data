how do you,
asks the chief of police,
patrol a city
where the butcher shops
are guarded by vultures;
where bulls get pregnant,
cows are barren,
and calves give milk
three times a day;
where mice are boatmen
and tomcats the boats
they row;
where frogs keep snakes
as watchdogs,
and jackals
go after lions?
does anyone know
what iâ€™m talking about?
says kabir.
