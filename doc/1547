when infant reason first exerts her sway,
and new-formed thoughts their earliest charms display;
then let the growing race employ your care
then guard their opening minds from folly’s snare;
correct the rising passions of their youth,
teach them each serious, each important truth;
plant heavenly virtue in the tender breast,
destroy each vice that might its growth molest;
point out betimes the course they should pursue;
then with redoubled pleasure shall you view
their reason strengthen as their years increase,
their virtue ripen and their follies cease;
like corn sown early in the fertile soil,
the richest harvest shall repay your toil.
