handsome, like those foam-topped tidal waves breaking high, in little crystal globes.
handsome, like the breeze that lifts a little tuft of tulle. if tulle were life.
handsome, like a frozen face, tear-tracked, when the sun hammers down.
handsome. like fire.
handsome, like the bottomless sky, with that one proud penetrating star.
but handsome, too, like a sky that’s an arching ocean, and an earth prone as an ocean’s floor.
handsome ocean-sky, and earth-sea floor.
            the big question is: where’s the man in a scene like this?
handsome: the man asleep. and the night sky swarms, tropic and wide.
handsome, in some ornamental, muggy midnight caught between cat’s paws. sharp-nailed:
            they prick.
handsome: the firefly swarms around you.
handsome, like a soap bubble grazing a little black dress. like a soap-bubble pricked with a pin.
handsomeness a rainbow, a rainbow an arrow, an arrow in my chest.
handsome, like shadows slow-rolling on a japanese screen.
handsome motion.
handsome as life and poison.
sun-blood handsome. bleeding sun.
