above the freeway, over the music,
we speak of the strategy of poems,
bleeding wives who ulcerate
our voices rhythming in the cut-heat
portland stink from the willamette river;
arteries of smog fixate this place
in each recording, music, music, on impulse.
this little racist community has few friends;
thousands of deerslayers hum into beaverton,
the one talk show driven out for their talk
as the liberals dig in to kgo out of san francisco;
we troop toward the lloyd center for the ice-skating,
the colorette bloomered dream merchants on rented skates,
and the sunday chronicle near the big hotel.
the poets, man and wife, write in the dimming air,
their daughter in the toy rooms connecting them,
the typewriter tacking the nails and snaps of her gown.
this image of separation begins in adoption:
her mother adopted out in san jose; her father
disowned, abandoned, torn out of the will; her name: phoebe.
and the sun does shine on them for this visit
in squat pigeontoes, and this beach ball sings.
