i’m not going to lie
through my teeth to you
like the poets from minnesota,
the south, and the west,
and new york city.
most of all in life
i would like to fuck a thirteen-year-old again,
and i don’t have any hesitations
about saying i’d rather be marlon brando
than i would t. s. eliot, etc.
i have more respect for muhammad ali
than any other living man.
of course i’ve tried esquire,
but my shoes aren’t platforms
and i don’t know shit about canoes.
although i can’t prove it,
most poets work for the highway dept.
there are more of them than there are
flies and engineers.
and i stink like a dead mule under an overpass.
