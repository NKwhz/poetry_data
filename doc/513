i'm remembering again, the day
we stood on the porch and you smoked
while the old man told you
about his basement full of wine,
his bad heart and the doctor's warning,
how he held the dusty bottle out to you,
glad, he said, to give it away
to someone who appreciated
its value and spirit, the years
it took to settle into its richness
and worth. i'm watching again,
each cell alive, as you reach
for the wine, your forearm exposed
below the rolled sleeve, the fine hairs
that sweep along the muscle, glowing,
lifting a little in the afternoon breeze.
i'm memorizing the shape of the moment:
your hand and the small bones
lengthening beneath the skin
as it tightens in the gripping,
in the receiving of the gift, the exact
texture and color of your skin,
and the old man's face, reduced
to its essence. that,
and the brief second
when both of you had a hand on the bottleâ€”
the thing not yet given,
not yet taken, but held
between you, stoppered, full.
and my body is flooded again
with an elemental joy,
holding onto it against another day
in the unknowable future when i'm given
terrible news, some dark burden
i'll be forced to carry. i know
this is useless, and can't possibly work,
but i'm saving that moment, for balance.
