in the middle of the night, father
brought me a falcon.
by morning, it ripped the wire and flew the hill
into the highway.
when they found me in that car
my sleeve stemmed in blood,
i didn’t know what it was
i was trying to kill.
i saw a craft of orphans steaming down the river.
they were dressed in white and silent as a séance.
it was then i spoke to the bird.
already god is shaking his black seed
back into me.
