in sweden, they whispered all winter,
counting the frozen minutes.
in france, they branched out. tips of experience.
in england, they dreamed of ireland.
in ireland they seemed to be lonely.
germany was belgium then was spain.
italy was something else again.
portugal, portugal, portugal:
they said that a lot because they never went back.
later in hungary, he lay on his back
and watched the clouds — so few of them
but each one big and fluffy. in the first dream
the angel was having a dream; in the next dream
the angel still clung to his story.
