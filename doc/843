the world weeps. there are no tears
to be found. it is deemed a miracle.
the president appears on screens
in villages and towns, in cities in jungles
and jungles still affectionately called cities.
he appears on screens and reads a story.
whose story is he reading and why?
what lessons are to be learned from this story
about a time that has not arrived, will not arrive, is here?
time of fire and images of fire climbing toward the sun
time of precious and semi-precious liquids
time of a man and a woman doused in ink
rolling across streams and down valleys
trying to leave some string of words behind.
