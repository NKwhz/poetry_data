one morning you open
one eye and listing to the south
it bulks like a barn,
noiseless, derelict
planks horizontal and deeply grooved.
a rudder the size of your front door
pivots as you push. once
inside you can smell
the fear of every winged,
creeping and four-legged thing:
no water, no straw,
just shadow and bare wood.
where is the one promised
to wake beside you forever?
ox-eyed daisies, goldenrod, cloverâ€”
why are you breathing
among them, why don't you gather
the outcast beasts or become one...
