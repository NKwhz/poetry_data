come, let’s go in.
the ticket-taker
has shyly grinned
and it’s almost time,
lovely one.
let’s go in.
the wind tonight’s too wild.
the sky too deep,
too thin. already it’s time.
the lights have dimmed.
come, loveliest.
let’s go in
and know these bodies
we do not have to own, passing
quietly as dreams, as snow.
already leaves are falling
and music begins.
lovely one,
it’s time.
let’s go in.
