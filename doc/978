hair still titian,
but botticelli's grip has loosened—
not now rubenesque,   
and probably never;
ingres approaches,   
but courbet might capture me.
could i be surreal?
it seems almost likely—
bells in my ears
and fortresses under;
cones have been set on my eyes.
my spring is gone
and summer's upon me,
rude in its ripening.
i'm espaliered, strung wide and tied,   
pinioned, and thus can i fly.
