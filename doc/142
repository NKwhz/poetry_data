1.  is all at least partially as you might wish?
2. was the flat even slightly in shape to be sent off?
and o what gravity sits upon me here
indeed i am a fellow with something of the world upon my shoulders.
i turn and say to you “now i work. i earn to learn!”

i am in a library for this week and then tickets to be taken.
and so i might tell you more of this
like a crow with wings that will not come down
a cock o’ the walk fluffing a pretty feather.
there is a thing i can’t shake from my mind though.
that limbo you must have automatically slipped me to.
i remember mentioning the fact of  it to a child
in my convent days
she neatly placed me with a slight half shiver
in that gray-green unborn world
i could taste the color — finger the dullfelt mute of a place.
you said, “and indeed that explains it!”
i, perhaps, see strings of nuns
like black pearls drawn slowly t’ards the step
and well there may be a star at the top
and there are the doleful moods of my mock-goblin godliness.
