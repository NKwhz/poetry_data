you can't argue beauty's not an accident, the particular heft and angle
of a chromosome's spin. a tarted spangle, bright lanyard twist, the slip
of cells weighting this boat uneven from stern to prow. we're all
skittery as marbles on  a marble floor. beauty stays, then goes;
it fades, we say, something about years and sun, the nights we slept
in makeup and left mascara like ashes on the pillowcase. we burned
through every one of our dreams. i wasn't always a stepmother, you know.
there were whole years when i was a girl. but now, these ladies
sell me moisturizer, stand close in their lab coats, pretending at science
in a fog of perfume. they wield a contour brush and my cheekbone pops.
the magic settles uneasy; it turns out fairy dust was always
fake. and the lipstick's made from beetles, shells crushed vermillion.
my color is fleshpot, they say, it's folie or fixation. it's wilderness;
it's artificial earth. they can't quite make themselves care.
we'll waste it, they know, whatever we've been given.
