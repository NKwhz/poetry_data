pigs prey to piggishnesses. get ate from the rooter to the tooter.
i’m a hog for you baby, i can’t get enough go the wolfish crooner.
the gust buffeted porker roll in the hay or laid down
              in twig rapine. let me in, let me in.
              no drum-gut, stagger’s stomach a tenement:
his deadeye bigger than his brick house.
stagger lee live by the want and die by the noose,
whose greedy void like a whorehouse
              full of empties getting full. can’t get enough!
rumored stagger would root through pussy
to plumb a fat boy. here piggy! what lee see he seize.
manful, ham-fisted. sorry billy,
              your name mud and who love dirt like swine?
they get in it like a straw house. it’ll be cold out
before lee admit his squeals weren’t howls.
he got down. he get dirty.
