a drowned drayman was hoisted on to the slab.
someone had jammed a lavender aster
between his teeth.
as i made the incision up from the chest
with a long knife
under the skin
to cut out tongue and gums,
i must have nudged it because it slipped
into the brain lying adjacent.
i packed it into the thoracic cavity
with the excelsior
when he was sewn up.
drink your fill in your vase!
rest easy,
little aster!
