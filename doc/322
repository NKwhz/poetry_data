who won? i said.
the game’s tomorrow, he said.
and i became the snail i always was,
crossing the field in my helmet.
but i’d given it my all,
while the plane arced on its way
to a landing, when i overheard
the woman behind us say
i was gathering wildflowers to make a wreath
to lay on my mother’s grave when my son
fell off a mountain in italy
and i felt such joy over the unknown
outcome of her words
i was not ashamed,
for i can feign interest
in the world, just as she
in that great green meadow
must have.
