i. at ten
   1955. a scratchy waltz
   buzzed over the ice rink’s p.a.
   my classmate tony, the barber’s son: “alls
   he wantsa do is, you know, like, play.”
   bored with perfecting my languid figure eights,
   i trailed him to a basement door marked gents
   with its metal silhouette of high-laced skates
   (symbols, i guess, of methods desire invents).
   tony’s older brother was waiting inside.
   i’d been “requested,” it seemed. he was sixteen,
   tall, rawboned, blue-eyed,
   thumbs hooked into faded, tightening jeans.
   i fumbled with small talk, pretending to be shy.
   looking past me, he slowly unzipped his fly.
 
 
ii. callas
   her voice: steeped in a rancid syrupy phlegm:
   whatever’s not believed remains a grace
   while again she invokes the power that yields:
   splintered timber and quick consuming flame:
   the simplest way to take hold of the heart’s
   complications, its pool of spilt religion:
   a long black hair sweat-stuck to the skin:
   the bitter sleep of the dying: the jew in berlin:
   who sent you here? the sharp blade pleads:
   stormcloud: thornhedge: starchill:
   blood bubble floating to the top of the glass:
   the light, from fleshrise to soulset:
   the world dragging the slow weight of its shame
   like the train of pomp: guttering candle: her voice.
 
iii. in class
   parasangs, satraps, the daily drill . . .
   beginner’s greek its own touchstone.
   the sophomore teacher was father moan,
   whom i longed to have praise my skill.
   the illustrated reader’s best
   accounts of murder and sacrifice
   only suggested the heavy price
   i longed to pay at his behest.
   he’d slap the pointer against his thigh.
   i quivered. what coldness may construe
   of devotion was an experience
   as hard to learn as catch his eye.
   i kept my hand up. here! i knew
   the right answer. the case. the tense.
