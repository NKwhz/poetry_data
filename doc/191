blood of an eye: tamarisk gall.
blood from a shoulder: bear’s breach.
from the loins: chamomile.
blood from a head: lupine.
a hawk’s heart: heart of wormwood.

schematic humans    ...    figures of them, & their helpers    ...
pheromones rise
    odd jagged breath lines, serpentine imagination,
l-shaped

name them, say them, dis-articulated    ...
drowned

but frequencies in “settlement” contexts    ...    where
scent might rise from
migrant distances & disappearances
    child keeps saying keep the bottle    don’t smash    ...    my water, my life    ...
or death aroma, if it come

who will settle    ...    & you? all of you?
what is landing
        to transit?
artifacts seem solo today    ...    more horror, & twisted

some things get special treatment    ...
her head a succulent melon
her neck         for example, a slope of
yearning    ...    warnings    ...    something dark
in that jar    ...
        unguent
winding bandages, shrouds for beautiful bodies
or useful equipment covered with ocher    ...    always red in rust    ...
and hoisting those urgently dead,
    & stink of the dead
•
......    wheels, mainstays: coils and springs, tense feet
pebbles! notice them?
& their incisions, sitting in bowls
lending credibility    ...
......    decorated pebbles
& from chambers, like strings of agate    ...
you want to enter to get a dark glow    ...    you want to get them back    ...
& there might be prayer, mantra, keening
there might be

some hesitant    ...    one walked to the shed, hides

sweet awe

working with willow rods that’s the method, bring great bundles of them, put on the ground, scatter them
pronounce them, saying:
“here’s one”
“here’s another one”
“here’s one, there    ...    over there    ...    ”
willow rods, very consoling      you don’t have to be a scythian    ...
        you don’t have to be syrian to know this
pronounce what you want to say
& then the ones more like women use a different method
they take a piece of the inner bark of a lime tree
        & cut it into 3 pieces
which they keep twisting & untwisting around their fingers
        as they say    ...
“there’s a turn”
“there’s a turning”
“how many turnings in a twisty one?”
makes the pronouncers happy
staying up all night, notice the moon & its macabre signal
& hemp vapor tents on the horizon
walk upside down in the footprints of the living    ...
