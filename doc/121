why what a pettish, petty thing i grow,–
a mere, mere woman,–a mere flaccid nerve,-
a kerchief left out all night in the rain,
turned soft so,–overtasked and overstrained
and overlived in this close london life!
and yet i should be stronger.
                          never burn
your letters, poor aurora! for they stare
with red seals from the table, saying each,
'here's something that you know not.'
