a bullet is made of
copper or lead. 
gunpowder is
poured into the case. 
the firing pin hits the
primer at the back of
the bullet which starts
the explosion.  altogether, 
the bullet and the case are
typically about two inches in length
and weigh a few ounces.
my father said that
the vietcongs
told him and the other 
prisoners while in 
"re-education" camp
that they were not worth a bullet.
they would work for the vietcongs
and then die.
a bamboo tree is smooth, long
with roots that hold the earth 
with the strong grip of green
knuckles and fingers.
they are used to build houses,
fences, etc.
a bamboo tree can weigh sixty pounds
or more and be twenty feet tall. 
the prisoners were forced to
walk barefoot up the mountains
and carry bamboo back to the camp.
due to the weight of the bamboo,
they were only able to carry one
at a time.
