in early morning when the sun
is vague and birds are furious
names of children float
like smoke through the empty room:
ariadne, dark as seal skin
ian, fair-skinned baby
marina   terrence   alex   john
after dinner   pulled back from
talk of war and morals
their names glow like light
around a candle â€”
jack, my rampant youngest son
celia, my daughter who sings
but no children call from other rooms
no soft faces turn to kiss
each guest goodnight
or whisper that stars are a giant's eyes
there is only the slow still wait
through the opaque night
for morning and more names.
