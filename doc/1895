it was a life of exile under the trees.
my father came to the stockyards.
my mother from a farm.
in 1952 or 2 my parents flew from kansas city to indianapolis
to look for a house when my father was transferred.
i think of them far above me
small as birds when they flew,
and the earth to them was a sandbox in our backyard
where i made roads to a house i never found.
i often think of wives in tract houses.
the cows and pigs my father yarded
before they walked up the ramp to the kill.
sometimes i thought we were together
because of something terrible we had done.
my father's cherokee heritage tucked under
some sort of shame. the past _______
what was it? i call to them above me
no larger than a leaf.
