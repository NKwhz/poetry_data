all overgrown by cunning moss,
all interspersed with weed,
the little cage of “currer bell”
in quiet “haworth” laid.
this bird – observing others
when frosts too sharp became
retire to other latitudes –
quietly did the same –
but differed in returning –
since yorkshire hills are green –
yet not in all the nests i meet –
can nightingale be seen –
