in this story, she is fire-born:
knee-deep in the shuddering world.
in this story, she knows no fear,
for what is fractured is a near-bitten star,
a false-bearing tree,
or a dishonest wind.
in this story, fear is a house gone dry.
fear is not being a woman.
iâ€™m no ordinary woman, she says.
my dreams come true.
and she says and she is
and i say, yes, give me that.
