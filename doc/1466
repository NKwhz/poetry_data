i hold my two-year-old son   
under his arms and start to twirl.   
his feet sway away from me   
and the day becomes a blur.   
everything i own is flying into space:   
yard toys, sandbox, tools,   
garage and house,   
and, finally, the years of my life.   
when we stop, my son is a grown man,   
and i am very old. we stagger   
back into each other's arms   
one last time, two lost friends   
heavy with drink,   
remembering the good old days.
