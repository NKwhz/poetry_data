you have such lovely bones, he says,
holding my face in his hands,
 
and although i can almost feel
the stone and the sand
 
sifting away, his fingers
like the softest of brushes,
 
i realize after this touch
he would know me
 
years from now, even
in the dark, even
 
without my skin.
thank you, i smileâ€”
 
then i close the door
and never call him again.
