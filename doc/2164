lightning hits the roof,
shoves the knife, darkness,
deep in the walls.
they bleed light all over us
and your face, the fan, folds up,
so i won’t see how afraid
to be with me you are.
we don’t mix, even in bed,
where we keep ending up.
there’s no need to hide it:
you’re snow, i’m coal,
i’ve got the scars to prove it.
but open your mouth,
i’ll give you a taste of black
you won’t forget.
for a while, i’ll let it make you strong,
make your heart lion,
then i’ll take it back.
