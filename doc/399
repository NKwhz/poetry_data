the poem can start with him walking backwards into a room.
he takes off his jacket and sits down for the rest of his life;
that’s how we bring dad back.
i can make the blood run back up my nose, ants rushing into a hole.
we grow into smaller bodies, my breasts disappear,
your cheeks soften, teeth sink back into gums.
i can make us loved, just say the word.
give them stumps for hands if even once they touched us without consent,
i can write the poem and make it disappear.
step-dad spits liquor back into glass,
mum’s body rolls back up the stairs, the bone pops back into place,
maybe she keeps the baby.
maybe we’re okay kid?
i’ll rewrite this whole life and this time there’ll be so much love,
you won’t be able to see beyond it.
