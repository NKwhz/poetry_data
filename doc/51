i would like
a century
a tree
grows slow
a crack
of light
hits my palm
while i’m
reading
i grab
to take
a picture
& the crack
is gone
branches
pouring
out of my
hands
days has made
its mark
i have
wind
swept
hair i think
of my step
brother
who i knew
more
like this
his face
a photo
graph
on a beach
on a
book &
when he died
i was
family
watching
a tree in
the wind
& i wanted
to speak
to him
who was
truly my
brother
that speck
of light is gone
on my
hand and
him. i told
her i’d probably
like to
end here
like my com
puters
do & my
dog did. i took
a chance
w horrifying
her. i’m
shooting
for this
love where
i live. see
me dying
now or running
across
the beach
to catch
the tree
book
cover in the end
of summer’s
wind. the ocean
is a feast
& it’s here
i bring my
water tree book
feet, taste
branches
the lot that
is me
who wants
a century.
