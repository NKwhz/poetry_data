three years before i’d hear the word / beaner /
from the / white boys / who’d spit first in my broccoli,
then in my hair, / my mother / dressed me
each wednesday in that / brown / sheath: i was seven.
it’d be the only time i’d wear a sash —
miss / america, / she said.
twenty miss / americas, we made /
kitsch from clothespins, pipe cleaners —
our / brown / socks / banded and complicated /
with orange tassels just below the / brown /
/ rosettes / of our knees, little / skulls / knocking
together in our elementary / school / cafeteria.
how we jumped the day / we heard / voices
raising there instead of / at home, / when tracy’s
mom slapped our / troop / leader / and tracy
cried. and tracy’s / mom was white /
and only her / dad was brown / and tracy
was a little / prettier than the rest of us. /
at the lunch tables, / white bitch / stuck to our fingers
like glue; / fucking mexicans / landed like glitter
onto the sashes laid across our / small / hearts. /
with tracy, / we watched / manifest between us
/ a line, / risen from the tiled floor where / we shared /
meals as tears clung to the eye-rims of my seven-year-old
/ compañeras. / lorena chewed her nails till blood
/ bloomed / on her ring finger. andrea peed quietly
/ on her brown knee / socks. none of us knew
where to hide. this was not / home, /
where / we could run / to the / broom / closet
or to the / feet / of our big / brothers. /
