the yellow line could be seen for as long a time
as the highway desired
and if you fell asleep at the wheel
it fulgurated in the dozing soul
like a brutal revelation
that allows you not to feel
in the dreamâ€™s snapshot
your brain getting smashed
against the milestone or the windshield   
 
it was an ideal line
crowned with horizontal blue
that unwound day after day
like a clothesline
flags and scalps and washed-out roses
our countries our combats our wars
mingling lassitude with involuntary starts
a gymnastic in disorder
that sickened our hearts
