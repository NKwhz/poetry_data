i have made love with pablo neruda
on the heights of machu picchu
i flashed the tattoo on my thigh
and hitched a lowride with luis rodriguez
i have held adrian louis close
and danced a wild reservation two-step
until beer cans and disposable diapers
spun around us like stars.
i have surrendered to leonel rugama’s
burning adolescent heat
and caressed roque dalton
from a luxuriance of bed sheets and red wine.
i stayed up all night reading sherman alexie,
nine months later, i gave birth to twin poems.
this lust is not heterosexual.
i devour nikki giovanni and patricia smith
like sao tome chocolate.
i have been known to steal away for
an afternoon tryst with julia de burgos.
i wrap nellie wong around me like a silk robe.
tonight, i have a date to share a steamy bath
with linda hogan and joy harjo
and it’s gonna be gooooood . . .
