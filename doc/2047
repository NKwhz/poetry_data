from child to youth; from youth to arduous man;
from lethargy to fever of the heart;
from faithful life to dream-dower'd days apart;
from trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;—
thus much of change in one swift cycle ran
till now. alas, the soul!—how soon must she
accept her primal immortality,—
the flesh resume its dust whence it began?
o lord of work and peace! o lord of life!
o lord, the awful lord of will! though late,
even yet renew this soul with duteous breath:
that when the peace is garner'd in from strife,
the work retriev'd, the will regenerate,
this soul may see thy face, o lord of death!
