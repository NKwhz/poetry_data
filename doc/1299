a gauze bandage wraps the land
and is unwound, stained orange with sulfates.
a series of slaps molds a mountain,
a fear uncoils itself, testing its long
cool limbs. a passing cloud
seizes up like a carburetor
and falls to earth, lies broken-
backed and lidless in the scree.
acetylene torches now snug
in their holsters, shop-vacs
trundled back behind the dawn.
a mist becomes a murmur, becomes
a moan deepening the dust-
choked fissures in the rock o pity us
ignatz o come to us by moonlight
o arch your speckled body over the earth.
