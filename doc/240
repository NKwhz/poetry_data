the first space shuttle launch got delayed until
sunday, so we had to watch the shuttle’s return
to earth in class instead—ps113’s paunchy black
& white rolled in, the antennae on top adjusted
sideways & down for better reception. that same
day, garrett stole my new pencil box. that same
day, cynthia peed her jeans instead of going
to the bathroom & letting garrett steal her pencil
box. both of us too upset to answer questions about
space flight, so we got sent to the back of the class.
i smelled like the kind of shame that starts a fight
on a tuesday afternoon. cynthia smelled like pee
& everyday jordache. the shuttle made its slick way
back to earth, peeling clouds from the monochromatic
sky & we all—even the astronomically marginal—
were winners. american, because a few days before,
a failed songwriter put a bullet in the president
in the name of jodie foster. the shuttle looked
like a bullet, only with wings & a cockpit, & when
it finally landed, the class broke into applause
& the teacher snatched a thinning american flag
from the corner, waved it back & forth in honor
of our wounded president & those astronauts.
