my itinerary is the eternity of exile.
deferred is the trip back into domicile.
my marching orders lost at sea;
my papers shrouded in an immigrant's secrecy.
lamar avenue in austin, texas is wide, long and it flows.
air-conditioned apartments allow for repose.
my transports and attachments to the past,
my dream-life, have an urgency that is never lost.
an exile's ultimate treat, tonight's dreamlike score:
a dinner with the zaidis in their islamabad home.
