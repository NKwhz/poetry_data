when it is cold it stinks, and not till then.
the seasonable or more rabid heats
of love and summer in some other cities
unseal the all too human: not in his.
when it is cold it stinks, but not before;
 
smells to high heaven then most creaturely
when it is cold. it stinks, but not before
his freezing eye has done its best to maim,
to amputate limbs, livelihood and name,
abstracting life beyond all likelihood.
 
when it is cold it stinks, and not till then
can it be fragrant. on canal and street,
colder and colder, murphy to molloy,
the weather hardens round the idiot boy,
the gleeful hero of the long retreat.
 
when he is cold he stinks, but not before,
this living corpse. the existential weather
smells out in these abortive minims, men
who barely living therefore altogether
live till they die; and sweetly smell till then.
