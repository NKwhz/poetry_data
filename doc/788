glad, on
time pennies
click hard
at your teeth
everyone is throwing them
gathered about you in a circle
on the deck
everyone is catching them
a blue flame about their heads cocked back
               over the railing
glass
you think
in the middle
and wheat stands from which time
is made
on the upper decks’
passing of the banks
that’s not the brittle
moment above you
on shore, leaves turn
their gray
sunless sides
every which way
the riverboat
is very small
it will never get here
