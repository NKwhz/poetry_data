why this sudden at-homeness, all-out, all-in?
i can, look, sink myself into you, glacierlike,
you yourself slay your brothers:
earlier than they
i was with you, snowed one.
throw your tropes
in with the rest:
someone wants to know,
why with god i
was no different than with you,
someone
wants to drown in that,
two books instead of lungs,
someone who stabbed himself into
you, bebreathes the cut,
someone, he was the one closest to you,
gets lost to himself,
someone adorns your sex
with your and his betrayal,
maybe
i was both
