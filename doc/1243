i.  let's look then at the desert of atacama
ii. let's look at our loneliness in the desert
so that desolate before these forms the landscape becomes
a cross extended over chile and the loneliness of my form
then sees the redemption of the other forms:   my own
redemption in the desert
iii.  then who would speak of the redemption of my form
iv.  who would tell of the desert's loneliness
so that my form begins to touch your form and your form
that other form like that until all of chile is nothing but
one form with open arms:   a long form crowned with thorns
v.   then the cross will be nothing but the opening arms
     of my form
vi.  we will then be the crown of thorns in the desert
vii.  then   nailed form to form   like a cross
      extended over chile   we will have seen forever
      the final solitary breath of the desert of atacama
