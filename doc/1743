in the beginning was the word
and the word was
death
and the word was nigger
and the word was death to all niggers   
and the word was death to all life   
and the word was death to all
   peace be still
the genesis was life   
the genesis was death   
in the genesis of death   
was the genesis of war
   be still peace be still
in the name of peace   
they waged the wars   
   ain’t they got no shame
in the name of peace
lot’s wife is now a product of the morton company   
   nah, they ain’t got no shame
noah packing his wife and kiddies up for a holiday   
row row row your boat
but why’d you leave the unicorns, noah
huh? why’d you leave them
while our black madonna stood there
eighteen feet high holding him in her arms   
listening to the rumblings of peace
    be still be still
can i get a witness? witness? witness?
he wanted to know
and peter only asked who is that dude?
who is that black dude?
looks like a troublemaker to me
and the foundations of the mighty mighty         
ro man cat holic church were laid
   hallelujah jesus
   nah, they ain’t got no shame
cause they killed the carthaginians   
in the great appian way
and they killed the moors
“to civilize a nation”
and they just killed the earth
and blew out the sun
in the name of a god
whose genesis was white
and war wooed god
and america was born
where war became peace
and genocide patriotism
and honor is a happy slave
cause all god’s chillun need rhythm
and glory hallelujah why can’t peace
   be still
the great emancipator was a bigot   
   ain’t they got no shame
and making the world safe for democracy
were twenty millon slaves
   nah, they ain’t got no shame
and they barbecued six million
to raise the price of beef
and crossed the 38th parallel
to control the price of rice
   ain’t we never gonna see the light
and champagne was shipped out of the east   
while kosher pork was introduced
to africa
   only the torch can show the way
in the beginning was the deed   
and the deed was death
and the honkies are getting confused   
   peace be still
so the great white prince
was shot like a nigger in texas
and our black shining prince was murdered   
like that thug in his cathedral
while our nigger in memphis
was shot like their prince in dallas
and my lord
ain’t we never gonna see the light
the rumblings of this peace must be stilled   
   be stilled be still
ahh black people   
ain’t we got no pride?
