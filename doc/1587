the night sits wherever you are. your night
is of lilac. every now and then a gesture escapes
from the beam of your dimples, breaks the wineglass
and lights up the starlight. and your night is your shadow—
a fairy-tale piece of land to make our dreams
equal. i am not a traveler or a dweller
in your lilac night, i am he who was one day
me. whenever night grew in you i guessed
the heart’s rank between two grades: neither
the self accepts, nor the soul accepts. but in our bodies
a heaven and an earth embrace. and all of you
is your night ... radiant night like planet ink. night
is the covenant of night, crawling in my body
anesthetized like a fox’s sleepiness. night diffusing a mystery
that illuminates my language, whenever it is clearer
i become more fearful of a tomorrow in the fist. night
staring at itself safe and assured in its
endlessness, nothing celebrates it except its mirror
and the ancient shepherd songs in a summer of emperors
who get sick on love. night that flourished in its jahili poetry
on the whims of imru’ el-qyss and others,
and widened for the dreamers the milk path to a hungry
moon in the remoteness of speech ...
