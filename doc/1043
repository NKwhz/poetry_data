pulp,   manna,   gentle
                    theriasin, ergot
like mold on flame, these red leaves
bursting
                    from mesquite by the side
of dry creekbed.         extract
the tar, the sticky
substance
                    heart
                                of things

            the inner man w/the coction

            like worms of light in quicksilver
not the false
            puffballs of marshfire,      extract
the heart of the empty heart
                     it is full
of the star soul that paces fierce
in the deeps of earth
                       the red man,
                                                 healer
in furs
            who carries a club
who carries
             the pale homunculus
in his belly.
                         for you are angel, you call
the soul from plants
                      or pearls of ambergris
out of the grudging sea.
                       extract arcanum.  separate
true archeus from the false
                       the bitter
is not less potentâ€”nor does clarity
bespeak truth.
                        out of the heart of the ineffable
draw the black flecks of matter
                               & from these
the cold, blue fire.
                               dry water.   immerse
yourself
              though it be but a drop.
                                                           this iliaster
flowers like the wind.
               out of the ash, the eidolon of the world
crystalline.
                  perfect.
