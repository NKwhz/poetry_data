tremendous orange things are happening somewhere.
i lay a wooden stick for stirring on the white note
on the desk. i lay a stain on the clean note.
somewhere things are happening. marvelous orange
and purple things. flooding rivers at dusk, wheels threading
roads in the desert. strangers. strangers. sea.
somewhere you are lying in a white bed. the clock
on your thigh is ticking. somewhere a human form
is being lifted from the ground.
somewhere, yes, and i am counting. the clean note
with its numbers has changed. i will remember.
you are a location, with a bed.
the road ends somewhere in the flooding river
at dusk. why here, strangers. a cartwheel in the stow hold
of a ship. a stranger who wheels it on the ice.
somewhere the ship has frozen. the ship has frozen
in the ice. a frozen form. the ship cannot be lifted
from the purple sky at dusk.
stain in the somewhere. you are lying in a white bed.
why here is the river. on the thigh. remember
what we did with clocks. orange and purple.
lovely trees in the frozen sky. holding somewhere and threading
thighs. strangers. i lay a stain on the white bed.
remembering what tremendous purple things we did.
the mind ends every thing stirring. somewhere the ship
is being lifted from the desert. marvelous. you will change
from the river location to the sea.
somewhere, things are happening. you are lying in the white bed
beside the sea with coffee. i am lying in the white bed.
tremendous strangers. blind roads in the sea.
