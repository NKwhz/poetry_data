have you been in our wild west country? then
you have often had to pass
its cabins lying like birds’ nests in
the wild green prairie grass.
have you seen the women forget their wheels
as they sat at the door to spin—
have you seen the darning fall away
from their fingers worn and thin,
as they asked you news of the villages
where they were used to be,
gay girls at work in the factories
with their lovers gone to sea!
ah, have you thought of the bravery
that no loud praise provokes—
of the tragedies acted in the lives
of poor, hard-working folks!
of the little more, and the little more
of hardship which they press
upon their own tired hands to make
the toil for the children less:
and not in vain; for many a lad
born to rough work and ways,
strips off his ragged coat, and makes
men clothe him with their praise.
