turning to watch you leave,
i see we must always walk toward
other loves, river of   heaven
between two office buildings.
orphaned cloud, fish soup poppling,
book spined in the open palm. unstoppable light.
i think it is all right.
or do tonight, garden toad
a speaking stone,
young sound in an old heart.
annul the self? i float it,
a day lily in my wine. oblivion?
i love our lives,
keeping me from it.
