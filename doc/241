when i was three,
a tsunami hit town.
“daddy, daddy, save me,
don’t let me drown.”
he saved me
and my common-type dolls.
 
when i was sixteen,
another tsunami hit town.
i cried to my daddy,
“daddy, daddy, please save me,
don’t let me drown!”
but he let go of my hand!
 
i still dance
to what broke on my life.
