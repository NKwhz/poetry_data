‘o jesus christ! i’m hit,’ he said; and died.
whether he vainly cursed or prayed indeed,
                 the bullets chirped—in vain, vain, vain!
                 machine-guns chuckled—tut-tut! tut-tut!
                 and the big gun guffawed.
another sighed,—‘o mother,—mother,—dad!’
then smiled at nothing, childlike, being dead.
                 and the lofty shrapnel-cloud
                 leisurely gestured,—fool!             
                 and the splinters spat, and tittered.
‘my love!’ one moaned. love-languid seemed his mood,
till slowly lowered, his whole face kissed the mud.
                 and the bayonets’ long teeth grinned;
                 rabbles of shells hooted and groaned;
                 and the gas hissed.
