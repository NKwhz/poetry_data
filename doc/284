where there’s smoke
there are mirrors
and a dry ice machine,
industrial quality fans.
if i’ve learned anything
about the present moment
 
•
but who doesn’t
love a flame,
the way one leaps
into being
full-fledged,
then leans over
to chat
  •
already the light
is retrospective,
sourceless,
is losing itself
though the trees
are clearly limned.
