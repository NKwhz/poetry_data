touch swollen tonsils:
gill slits.
inside eyelid: slimelight.
cheek: shark.
here foreknown
i’ve dived
down dawnless
microbial snows,
phosphor blue to blue-
black, to black.
i fend
fish. i find
the saffron curb
of   the sulfur vent,
veering voiceless
again into the segmented,
swaying, white,
toothed tube-
worm, time.
