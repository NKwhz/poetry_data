you wouldn't have believed it, how
the man, a little touched perhaps,
set his hands together and prayed
for happiness, yet not his own;
he meant his people, by which he meant
not people really, but trees and cows,
the dirty horses, dogs, the fox
who lived at the back of his place with her kits,
and the very night who settled down
to rock his place to sleep, the place
he tried so hard to tend he found
he mended fences in his sleep.
he said to the you above, who, let's
be honest, doesn't say too much,
i need you now up there to give
my people happiness, you let
them smile and know the reason; hear
my prayer, old yam. the you who's you
might laugh at that, and i agree,
it's funny to make a prayer like that,
the down-home words and yonder reach
of what he said; and calling god
the elder sweet potato, shucks,
that's pretty funny, and kind of sad.
