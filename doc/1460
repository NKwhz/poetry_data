the carpet in the kindergarten room
was alphabet blocks; all of us fidgeting
on bright, primary letters. on the shelf
sat that week's inflatable sound. the th
was shaped like a tooth. we sang
about brushing up and down, practiced
exhaling while touching our tongues
to our teeth. next week, a puffy u
like an upside-down umbrella; the rest
of the alphabet deflated. some days,
we saw parents through the windows
to the hallway sky. look, a fat lady,
a boy beside me giggled. until then
i'd only known my mother as beautiful.
