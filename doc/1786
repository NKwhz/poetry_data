it is the miller’s daughter,
and she is grown so dear, so dear,
that i would be the jewel
that trembles at her ear:
for hid in ringlets day and night,
i’d touch her neck so warm and white.
and i would be the girdle
about her dainty, dainty waist,
and her heart would beat against me,
in sorrow and in rest:
and i should know if it beat right,
i’d clasp it round so close and tight.
and i would be the necklace,
and all day long to fall and rise
upon her balmy bosom,
with her laughter or her sighs:
and i would lie so light, so light,
i scarce should be unclasped at night.
