when you said no,
             i went for your dresser,
opened the top drawer,
             broke the paper seals
on the two sterile cups,
             and wiped my dirty
thumbs inside.
             because our stubborn love
won’t die, i have to kill it,
            will it dead. or so
i thought until i passed
             a cycle on my own.
you’ve no idea
             what’s grown
inside me
             since i bled.
