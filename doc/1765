soul and race
are private dominions,   
memories and modal
songs, a tenor blossoming,
which would paint suffering   
a clear color but is not in   
this victorian house
without oil in zero degree
weather and a forty-mile-an-hour wind;
it is all a well-knit family:   
a love supreme.
oak leaves pile up on walkway
and steps, catholic as apples
in a special mist of clear white   
children who love my children.   
i play “alabama”
on a warped record player
skipping the scratches
on your faces over the fibrous   
conical hairs of plastic
under the wooden floors.
dreaming on a train from new york   
to philly, you hand out six
notes which become an anthem
to our memories of you:
oak, birch, maple,
apple, cocoa, rubber.
for this reason martin is dead;
for this reason malcolm is dead;
for this reason coltrane is dead;
in the eyes of my first son are the browns   
of these men and their music.
