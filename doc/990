use me
abuse me
            turn wheels of ﬁre
            on manhole hotheads
sing me
sour me
            secrete dark matter’s sheen
            on our smarting skin
rise and shine
in puddle shallows
            under every meryl cheryl caleb syd
            somnambulists and sleepyheads
wake us
speak to us
            bless what you’ve nurtured in your pits
            the rats voles roaches and all outlivers
            of your obscene ethic and politics
crawl on us
fall on us
            you elevations that break and vein
            down to sulfuric ﬁber-optic wrecks
            through drill-bit dirt to bedrock
beat our brows
flee our sorrows
            sleep tight with your ultraviolets
            righteous mica and drainage seeps
your gorgeous color-chart container ships
and cab-top numbers squinting in the mist
