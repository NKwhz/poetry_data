eat thou and drink; to-morrow thou shalt die.
surely the earth, that's wise being very old,
needs not our help. then loose me, love, and hold
thy sultry hair up from my face; that i
may pour for thee this golden wine, brim-high,
till round the glass thy fingers glow like gold.
we'll drown all hours: thy song, while hours are toll'd,
shall leap, as fountains veil the changing sky.
now kiss, and think that there are really those,
my own high-bosom'd beauty, who increase
vain gold, vain lore, and yet might choose our way!
through many years they toil; then on a day
they die not,—for their life was death,—but cease;
and round their narrow lips the mould falls close.
