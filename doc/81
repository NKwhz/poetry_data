i’m in charge of a cage. i know those that won’t.
i don’t mean can’t. just won’t. there’s a roster
for tuesdays, fridays. dogs to die.
the disconsolate, the abandoned, those with recurrent
symptoms, the incorrigible mutt — oh, a dozen
choices by way of reasons. even so,
some won’t. won’t play along once their number’s
up. the “rainbow bridge” in the offing
as the posher clinics put it, a pig’s ear
as a final treat, a venison chew, the profession
behaving beautifully at a time like this.
still, those that won’t. won’t go nicely, i mean,
with a gaze to melt, a last slobbed lick.
those with a soul’s defiance, though embarrassment
in the lunchroom should you come at that one!
even after the bag is zipped, you feel it:
we’re real at the end as you are, buster. we sniff
the wind. what say if we say it together? won’t.
