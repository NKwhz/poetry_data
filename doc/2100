scots, wha hae wi' wallace bled,
scots, wham bruce has aften led;
welcome to your gory bed,
         or to victory!
now's the day, and now's the hour;
see the front o' battle lour;
see approach proud edward's power—
         chains and slavery!
wha will be a traitor knave?
wha can fill a coward's grave!
wha sae base as be a slave?
         let him turn and flee!
wha for scotland's king and law
freedom's sword will strongly draw,
freeman stand, or freeman fa',
         let him follow me!
by oppression's woes and pains!
by your sons in servile chains!
we will drain our dearest veins,
         but they shall be free!
lay the proud usurpers low!
tyrants fall in every foe!
liberty's in every blow!—
         let us do or die!
