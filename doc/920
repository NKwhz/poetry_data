when this day returns to me
i will value your heart,
long hurt in long division,
over mine. mouth above mine too —
say you love me, truth never more
meant, say you are angry.
words, words we net with our mouths.
soul is an old thirst but not as first
as the body’s perhaps,
though on bad nights its melancholy
eats us out, to a person.
true, time is undigressing.
yet true is all we can be:
rhyming you, rhyming me.
