i
look out the window in upstate new york, see
the mediterranean stretching out below me
down the rocky hillside at faro, three
years, two months, fourteen days earlier .
8:25 a. m.
rosemary gone back to sleep, pink & white . i
stand at the livingroom window drinking coffee, open
the doors to the balcony . warmth beginning, tho
i wrap my hands around the cup, count
fishing boats in the sunglare, moving shoreward now
slowly, or
sitting there motionless on the flat sea .
a fat blue arm stretches out from the coast, ripples
where wind and currents show
muscle below the blue skin of sea
stretched out below me .
                                                  the coffeeâ€™s
cold toward the end of the cup . i go
back to the kitchen for more hot . put
orange in bathrobe pocket, reach for knife, return
to the balcony with the fresh cup where the flat blue sea
fills my eye in the sunglare . stretches out below me.
 
the southern tier:    the maple outside the window
warms in the early sun . red buds at the ends of branches
commence their slow bursting . green soon
                                                           joan moves
                           her legs against mine in the hall, goes down to
start my egg . carlos thumps the lower stairs . we move.
 
all our farewells al-
ready prepared inside us   .   aaaall our
deaths we carry inside us, double-yolked, the
fragile toughness of the shell   .   it makes
sustenance possible, makes love    possible
as the red buds break against the sunglight
possible green, as legs move against legs
possible softnesses     .     the soft-boiled
egg is ready now  .
                                                       now we eat.
 
                                                                                        19  .  iv  .  71
