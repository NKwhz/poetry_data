don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
let the radiant thought last in stillness
though the page is almost filled and the flame flickers
we haven't risen yet to the level of ourselves
knowledge grows slowly like a wisdom tooth
the stature of a man is still notched
high up on a white door
from far off, the joyful voice of a trumpet
and of a song rolled up like a cat
what passes doesn't fall into a void
a stoker is still feeding coal into the fire
don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
on a hard dry substance
you have to engrave the truth
