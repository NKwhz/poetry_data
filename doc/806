beef: we are here between trees,
with the tempo of a rosary being strung
in a queue of escalating beadsâ€”
beef: it's not quite the count in
the countinghouse of my chest
but the heart does make an awful attempt
beef: a tee and a circle wherever it may
be there was music coming on
beef: which though machinery-like
moves not in cogs, and never
springs, but waves through
beef: like wired applause for antic backstage
buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz; but it
fades
beef: but only after the chorus has pulsed
beef: it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain
water gone dross
beef: or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us, and is for some arc
fully quiet...
beef: until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir's
circuit opens to one
beef: like a pigeon unhinged, its wings in sudden
white-rumped ascent
beef: unopposed by iridescence
beef: unopposed by iridescence
