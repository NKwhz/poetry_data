the poppies start as aliens
end as husbands, a pause
of light, a dull scatter.
transports dandelion clouds.
venus passes between sun &
earth. exceedingly rare, transit,
have you noticed how close
the ode & elegy are?
(in the united states someone
dies every sixteen seconds!)
husband, supermoon, venus
come & go. death says there
is no you at the end of weather.
"among the rarest of all predictable
astronomical . . ." husband
presented me. the weatherman
says we are locked in the clouds.
