i was listening for the dog
when the locks were pried open.
the man was dead. the dog, a survivor,
was dead. it happens
 
more often this way.
a disease left
untreated; the body,
in confusion, gives in.
 
the bomb breathes its fire down
the hallway, the son comes back
in pieces; the body,
in confusion, gives in.
 
the grief is a planet. a dust ring.
a small moon that’s been hidden
under my pillow, that’s been changing
the way my body moves this whole time.
