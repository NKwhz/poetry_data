the sun time of the year died out and never might return.
we made fires big as coffee tables to approximate the sun.
i wanted to be a mountain.
i wanted us all countless mountains in a detailed painting.
blood is everywhere as always.
but now it is blown further and oxygenated for longer.
yet more sad word has come digitally.
we contain no blood with which to soften and warm the sad word.
cold wind placed and places the house in its mouth.
we met the end numb and almost still.
number meant less motion meant even number meant totally still.
the buildings stand still.
the buildings still stand.
the buildings like the builders take each other by the hand.
