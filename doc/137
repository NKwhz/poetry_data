what are you going to do
with what is left of yourself
now among the rustling
of your maybe best years?
this is not an auto-elegy
with me pouring my heart
out into where you
differently stand or sit
on the epidaurus steps.
what shall i say to myself
having put myself down
on to a public page?
where am i going now?
and where are you going
tricked into reading
words of my later life?
let me pretend you are
roughly of my age.
are you a boy or a girl?
and what has happened to you?
look at the chirping various
leaves of mr grahamâ€™s
spanking summer. where are
you at? i know my face
has changed. my hair has blanched
into a wrong disguise
sitting on top of my head.
beside each other perched
on the epidaurus steps.
where am i going to go?
shall i rise to follow
the thin sound of the goats
tinkling their bells?
