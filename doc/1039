—not pen. it’s got
that same silken
dust about it, doesn’t it,
that same sense of
having been roughed
onto paper even  
as it was planned.
it had to be a labor
of love. it must’ve
taken its author some
time, some shove.
i’ll bet it felt good
in the hand—the o
of the ocean, and
the and and the and
of the land.
