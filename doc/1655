in the house of the voice of maria callas   
we hear the baby’s cries, and the after-supper   
rattle of silverware, and three clocks ticking   
to different tunes, and ripe plums   
sleeping in their chipped bowl, and traffic sounds   
dissecting the avenues outside.   we hear, like water   
pouring over time itself, the pure distillate arias   
of the numerous pampered queens who have reigned,   
and the working girls who have suffered   
the envious knives, and the breathless brides   
with their horned helmets who have fallen in love   
and gone crazy or fallen in love and died   
on the grand stage at their appointed moments—   
who will sing of them now?   maria callas is dead,   
although the full lips and the slanting eyes   
and flared nostrils of her voice resurrect   
dramas we are able to imagine in this parlor   
on evenings like this one, adding some color,   
adding some order.   of whom it was said:   
she could imagine almost anything and give voice to it.
