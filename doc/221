once i have the freedom to say
my tongue will lose its power.
since my poems strive to break the walls
that cut off peopleâ€™s voices,
they become drills and hammers.
 
but i will be silenced.
the starred tie around my neck
at any moment can tighten into a cobra.
 
how can i speak about coffee and flowers?
