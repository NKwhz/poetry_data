come our one great bushfire
pigs, sty-released, declined to quit
their pavements of gravel and shit.
other beasts ran headlong, whipping
off with genitals pinched high.
human mothers taught their infants creek-dipping.
fathers galloped, gale-blown blaze stripping
grass at their heels and on by
too swift to ignite any houses.
one horse baked in a tin shed,
naked poultry lay about dead
having been plucked in mid flight
but where pigs had huddled
only fuzzy white hoofprints led
upwind over black, b b b
and none stayed feral in our region.
