after our rendez-vous—this the last word he said,
waving to me as the train pulled away from the station.
and so it seemed: harmless. till evening brought
the first prick of fever, which soon trellised my veins;
at 2 am came that knock on the city gates,
little pig, little pig, let me come in. . . .
ha! ever a bold and warlike people, we didn’t.
 
days of siege. we threw corpses dead of plague
from the tops of parapets to frighten it away:
but what was it? that vatic voice was not like his at all,
and by its speech one could tell it somehow knew us well.
the mystery deepened. a strange billowing cloud
made my people short of breath, i heard them wheezing.
the end seemed near. what could this ailment be?
 
hunting  out clues, i went over the roses and snows
of his departed face like a treasure map, over
his words hanging in air like the scrolls of alexandria.
had i not been consensual, a free agent,
gay, single as any singing lark, who
chooses to unlock, to whom? well?
one night, finally, i climbed our tallest tower, lay
 
in the open on its roof and had a brilliant dream.
i saw my body nestled between angels
like the body of the prophet jesus, i saw it
leaking from a finger’s tip like a slit ragdoll.
and then i saw: this feathery, amorphous creature
black as mildew in the bath, soft as bread mold,
chewing on my bloodpuddings in the corner.
 
and then i knew! that morning, i went out by the porter’s door
pressing one finger to judicious lips like oedipus.
your name, i said, i have it now: despair—
shrieking, it vanished with brimstone and flames.
so i etched harmless in that ground of merds and moss
and to this day, my people listen to strangers crying wares
with an intelligent ear, remembering our grave old danger.
