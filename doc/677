stilled as in image, at dawn sliding into
blue harbor, boats clang, where does he
the man i imagine gripping several ropes
return from. is he conflicted, does he
perceive the sky oscillating like
a dimmer machine, a mouth, a war, language
not declaring its most
effective self, bellum grazing ever
nearer to beauty, a possible apotheosis how
what is left of sense
is comfort. not inebriated much anymore,
i rented a lawn to stand in with you, crueler
was always singing to our mutual forks,
knives. our translation
of a subject drones
on unblinking, something black for him
returning, his forearms there laid
themselves down, ships gone out another
pale-plated night.
