in fat armchairs sat
indolence and impatience,
plotting my downfall
      *
a wicked cage flew
across the long horizon
searching for a bird.
      *
i burned with love in
empty rooms, i sternly turned
knives within myself.
      *
“behold the bright gate,”
the keeper said. “i am now
going to shut it.”
      *
hardly was the road
swept clean when ah! there appeared
new piles of dry leaves.
      *
but nothing could kill
a faith like a guillotine,
as heavy, as light.
      *
happiness? finding
your indestructible core;
leaving it alone.
      *
into the heavens
flew a breathless legion of
impossible crows.
