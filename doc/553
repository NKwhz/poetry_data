i imagine each enunciation, each syllable
pronounced—mississippi—makes a noose
cinch somewhere, rope reduced
to arousal, tightening. the pull,
the hard-learned feel of vertebrae supple
within a neck's column, and marrow's juice
sucked clean until what remains are flutes
of bone, a wind section of rubble.
whenever i meet mississippi in a dream,
it is always a landfill of labored breaths
or a grand mammal crippled in morass.
what did you ever want of us? i ask. it beams,
the same you want for me—the subtle heft
of razors beneath the magnolia tongue's lash.
