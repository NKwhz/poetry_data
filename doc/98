the likelihood of forgetting
the dress she wore when she was young
the road to likas bay
pictures fell down in the earthquake
we could keep them
we could throw them all away
everything i never asked my grandmother

no one has played that piano since
new zealand is so far away from here
let me translate for you the poem on the wall
