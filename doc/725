a minor observer
                                 as in a dream
absorbed in the interior,
a beardless youth
                                   unaccountably
remote yet present
                                      at the action
reminding me faintly
                                          of prufrock. . . .
a diminutive figure
                                     barely discernible
seemingly ageless

                        into one exultant note

                      of the chest-space,
vibrating along

in the presence
                             of full-bodied
womanliness,
                          the eyes dark
in the inner scene,
                                   the hair long
and black,
                        our dark lady,
inmate of courtship.

                                       she is nameless.
the reason for her

a shepherd,
                        vaguely associated,

             at a distance
under
            a birch tree,
causally,

or diminish.
