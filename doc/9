when we look at ourselves
we see ourselves through eyes
which have been schooled
to see comely only the opaque, 
comely to us skin that is fair,
comely to us eyes that are light,
comely to us hair that is straight,
comely to us lips that are thin,
our gods and goddesses
glow in opalescent whiteness
and daily we worship at this shrine. 
ugly to us our satin black skin,
ugly to us our fulsome lips,
ugly to us our midnight eyes,
ugly to us our crisping hair
thus we have rejected our image. 
but this is not as it should be
we black people must be born again.
know that the black people like other races
have their own distinct beauty,
know that the stygian night too is beautiful.
