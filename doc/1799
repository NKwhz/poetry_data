i
1
pearl, the precious prize of a king,
chastely set in cherished gold,
in all the east none equalling,   
no peer to her could i behold.
so round, so rare, a radiant thing,
so smooth she was, so small of mold,
wherever i judged gems glimmering   
i set her apart, her price untold.
alas, i lost her in earth’s green fold;
through grass to the ground, i searched in vain.
i languish alone; my heart grows cold
for my precious pearl without a stain.
2
since in that spot it slipped from me,
i lingered, longing for that delight   
that from my sins once set me free
and my happiness raised to the highest height.
her going wounds me grievously;
it burns my breast both day and night.
yet i never imagined a melody
so sweet as she, so brief, and slight.
but memory flowed through my mind’s sight:
i thought how her color in clods had lain
o dust that dims what once was bright,
my precious pearl without a stain.
3
rare spices on that spot must spread:
such riches there to rot have run,
blooms of yellow and blue and red,
their sheen a shimmer against the sun,
flower and fruit nor faded nor dead,
where the pearl dropped down in mouldering dun;
each grass from a lifeless grain is bred,
else to harvest no wheat were won:
always from good is good begun.
so seemly a seed could not die in vain,
that sprig nor spice there would be none   
of that precious pearl without a stain.
4
to the spot which i in speech portray,
i entered in that arbor green,
in august on a holy day,
when the corn is cut with sickles keen.
on the little rise where my pearl rolled away,
the fairest flowers formed a screen:
gillyflower, ginger, gromwell spray,
with peonies powdered in between.
if they were seemly to be seen,
far sweeter the scents from that domain,
more worthy her dwelling, well i ween,
my precious pearl without a stain.
5
i mourned, hands clenched, before that mound,
for the piercing cold of grief had caught
me in the doleful dread and bound
my heart, though reason solace sought.
i longed for my pearl, locked in the ground,
while fierce contentions in me fought.
in christ, though comfort could be found,
my wretched will was still distraught.
i fell upon that flowery plot.
such odors eddied in my brain,
to sudden slumber i was brought
by that precious pearl without a stain.
