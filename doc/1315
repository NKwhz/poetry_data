the self  refuses to appear
         in this bare place.
it fears that mute chair
         and the still window.
the sunlight scares it.
there might rise up a sound.
the door doesn’t like to move,
         and the crow out there
         hesitates; he knows
         a hole flown into by mistake
         would make a bite of   him.
what was sits standstill in the chair,
         hangs, stunned, against the dry-eyed light.
nobody in sight.
inanimate things, still  lifeless.
this room’s so empty
         i doubt i’m standing here;
         there can’t be room for me
         and total emptiness.
only some far-off sounds persist.
the brute truck
         over the interstate.
the flames in the incinerator
         chewing his old vests.
