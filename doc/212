between the bent boughs
of the splayed sumac the silver
owl rests his head.
 
the perimeter
left by your absence is long
to walk in one day.
 
the angel in her
credenza of extreme beauty
dogs swim the river
 
i look for my heart
by the lamp where the light is
skitter in the wet black leaves
