the baboon is eating strawberries
expired on the shelf
of the ft. bragg safeway.
a coastal landscape
with waves
like inexpertly torn tinfoil hangs
above his left shoulder
at the check-in desk
of an abandoned motel.
the ocean itself
is only a sound
through a torn window screen
where some hardscrabble bush
about to flower
is just a smell.
will something appropriately
random please
happen to convince me
reality is still playing
with a full deck?
