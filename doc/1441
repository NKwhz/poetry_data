exert thy voice, sweet harbinger of spring!
    this moment is thy time to sing,
    this moment i attend to praise,
and set my numbers to they lays.
    free as thine shall be my song;
    as they music, short, or long.
poets, wild as thee, were born,
    pleasing best when unconfined,
    when to please is least designed,
soothing but their cares to rest;
    cares do still their thoughts molest,
    and still th' unhappy poet's breast,
like thine, when best he sings, is placed against a thorn.
she begins, let all be still!
    muse, they promise now fulfill!
sweet, oh! sweet, still sweeter yet
can thy words such accents fit,
canst thou syllables refine,
melt a sense that shall retain
still some spirit of the brain,
till with sounds like these it join.
    'twill not be! then change thy note;
    let division shake thy throat.
hark! division now she tries;
yet as far the muse outflies.
    cease then, prithee, cease thy tune;
    trifler, wilt thou sing till *june*?
till thy business all lies waste,
and the time of building's past!
    thus we poets that have speech,                                             
unlike what they forests teach,
    if a fluent vein be shown
    that's transcendant to our own,
criticize, reform, or preach,
or censure what we cannot reach.
