steel horses nodding
in the petroleum field are beasts
that suck
the crude of earth.
they have lived here for as long as i
remember. this moment,
 
i smell wild incense:
heather, abducted by a desert wind.
its growth hides
the rain-carved ribs of the foothills.
evening swallows
the city fasting on late fall.
 
years ago, after hearing the story
about a boy who lost
both legs while playing on an oil pump,
i was dared to straddle one.
all my friends were there to watch
the pacific behind me burning with dusk.
 
the brute lifted me to the sky,
where i merged with the twilight,
a warm breeze embracing my back.
none of them noticed
the world stopped to breathe.
when i looked, they disappeared.
 
nearby in pink-flowered bushes
someone found
the girl whoâ€™d been missing for weeks.
they stood in awe, the body
decomposing, while i rode
the slow bucking animal.
 
two months later, off the same pump,
a man dove,
an imperfect swan into night.
he landed in the dirt gully
breaking the soft, white wings
he never had.
 
today, i catch in my hand
an insect charged with lightning.
it tickles
the obscure scoop of my palm
as i hold it to my mouth and explain
a wish so simple
 
by morning i will have forgotten it.
i release
the bug to a desert wind
that is racing toward the sea,
a brutal dryness in its wake.
fire in the hills everywhere.
