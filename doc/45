i am afraid of your transcendental death.
when people say think of a man. i think of a brown man.
sometimes the earth grows khella because she can feel our suffering.
yooooooing beneath costco tikis.
when people say think of a man. i think of a white man.
i am meant to hold you in your oblique pain, your map-driven pain.
yooooooing beneath costco tikis.
i was drunk holding my teeth in like students.
i am meant to hold you in your oblique pain, your map-driven pain.
you die like an actor.
i was drunk holding my teeth in like students.
my body was a brown dog i shoved back into the water.
you die like an actor.
i beseeched but couldn’t stay out of the first person.
my body was a brown dog i shoved back into the water.
hold me, hold me, hold me, holdmeholdmeholdme.
i beseeched but couldn’t stay out of the first person.
where does it hurt, we say.
hold me, hold me, hold me, holdmeholdmeholdme.
i am afraid of your transcendental death.
