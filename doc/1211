that whine is the sound
of waste, rot, the frantic,
grinding inability to attend
to anything but sere thwarting
of yourself, a dry corrosion
which some say they know,
but you and iâ€”
 
(my jaw clenched as you
turn a page,
you with a heart like drywall,
i who would
lace my arms with razors,
then press them
slowly to your lips,
the metal taste
mixing with flesh,
and through gritted teeth
i making the sound
of you, you, you
do not know, meaning
only me, me)
 
we know best.
