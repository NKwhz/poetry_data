my mother's voice is at my throat
—"try a scarf in the neckline"—
and on my lips: "just a little
lipstick." today i'm wearing both.
my "mother's voice," pitched high, carries
reprimand and care:
"no boom on the table!" my daughter
swats me as i carry her
away from the dearest
activity on earth—sticks, stones, struck
as if the coffee table were a flint.
"barbarian," i croon
in heels. "what's that?" she asks and rips
a nylon with a fingernail.
she cries at the turtleneck
pulled over her head. "i'll give you something
to cry about!" i hush, succeeding for another
day, or an hour—another minute
late for work. tonight i'll choose
a lullaby: "bluebird
at my window," mother sang to me,
a voice that could broom sorrow
through the door . . . a decal
staggered on the painted bureau,
blue wing seeking, finding no way out.
