poetry chooses choice things, carefully selecting
select words, arranging,
fabulously, things arranged. to put it differently
is hard, if not out of the question.
poetry's like a clay plate. it's broken easily
under the weight of all those poems. in the hands
of the poet, it sings. in those of others, not only
doesn't it sing, it's out of the question.
