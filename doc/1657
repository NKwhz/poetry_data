i take pillows outdoors to sun them
as my mother did.  “keeps bedding fresh,”
she said.  it was april then, too—
buttercups fluffing their frail sails,
one striped bee humming grudges, a crinkle
of jonquils.  weeds reclaimed bare ground.
all of these leaked somehow
into the pillows, looking odd where they   
simmered all day, the size of hams, out of place
on grass.  and at night i could feel
some part of my mother still with me
in the warmth of my face as i dreamed
baseball and honeysuckle, sleeping
on sunlight.
