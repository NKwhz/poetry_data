the hinge of the year
the great gates opening
and then slowly slowly
closing on us.
i always imagine those gates
hanging over the ocean
fiery over the stone grey
waters of evening.
we cast what we must
change about ourselves
onto the waters flowing
to the sea. the sins,
errors, bad habits, whatever
you call them, dissolve.
when i was little i cried
out i! i! i! i want, i want.
older, i feel less important,
a worker bee in the hive
of history, miles of hard
labor to make my sweetness.
the gates are closing
the light is failing
i kneel before what i love
imploring that it may live.
so much breaks, wears
down, fails in us. we must
forgive our broken promisesâ€”
their sharp shards in our hands.
