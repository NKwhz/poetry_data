afterward, the compromise.
bodies resume their boundaries.
 
these legs, for instance, mine.
your arms take you back in.
 
spoons of our fingers, lips
admit their ownership.
 
the bedding yawns, a door
blows aimlessly ajar
 
and overhead, a plane
singsongs coming down.
 
nothing is changed, except
there was a moment when
 
the wolf, the mongering wolf
who stands outside the self
 
lay lightly down, and slept.
