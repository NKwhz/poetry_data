our
high and
mighty
termite
mound
arises
far above
the ground,
and just as
deep, grows
underground.
our nest is
blessed to be
immense.   it gives
us all a firm
defense, superior
to any fence.   it
shields us from our
enemies.   it keeps us
cooler, by degrees.
from floods and droughts
it guarantees.   a prize
nobody will assign in
architectural design, but
still our hill suits us just fine.
