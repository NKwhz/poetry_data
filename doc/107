blue numbers on my bedside clock
tell i forgot to change the hour.
this sets routines on haywire.
 
like a domestic goat staked
to its circle of earth.
i don’t do well untethered.
 
i have no hunger for early dinner,
become confused by the sound
of children who seem out
 
too late for a school night.
they’ve found an extra helping
of daylight to romp on new grass
 
and can’t contain themselves,
strip off jackets, scatter
like a rag of ponies.
 
whatever time says,
their joy insists
on springing forward.
