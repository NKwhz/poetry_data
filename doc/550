if it's teddy singing it—don't leave me
this way—it isn't the arrangement
your parents spun themselves through,
becoming another strobe-lit dervish. listen
as it pounds. think of them instead
not dancing but stilled in a corner,
buttressed by their own sweat
and clairvoyant uncertainty. every plea,
every atonement that reaches sweet
and hard from teddy's vocal folds,
is ambivalent toward their present,
its travails—the night humid, reduced to tissue
paper's fragility. it's june 1976, years before
code like mother and father—before either
is prepared to admit they could not imagine
the uphill slope of love after disco's
tongue licked the vinyl unfurrowed and the babies
—babies that began as mere pheromone
exchanges on a dance floor—
began falling into their young laps.
it isn't your fault. you did not stop the music.
or if you did, it was thelma houston's cover,
not this bearded prayer of negative capability—
the pleaseplease under each pace your parents took
beyond the cusp of realizing nothing so good
could stay that good so long.
