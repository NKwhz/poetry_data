i’ve known rivers:
i’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.
my soul has grown deep like the rivers.
i bathed in the euphrates when dawns were young.
i built my hut near the congo and it lulled me to sleep.
i looked upon the nile and raised the pyramids above it.
i heard the singing of the mississippi when abe lincoln went down to new orleans, and i’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.
i’ve known rivers:
ancient, dusky rivers.
my soul has grown deep like the rivers.
