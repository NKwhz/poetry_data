when he called, there were 261 emotions
at play. i thought there were only wistfulness,
humiliation, and mere bitterness left, but lo,
i see now the brilliance in the numbers. 
emotions 75 and 78 made me happy just to know
they existed. i felt less alone, more impervious. 
i was emboldened by the existence of 152. 
though, how was i supposed to accept 9, 14, and 179?
we deserved better, distress and indigence aside. 
something about 260 broke the spell inside me
and offered up a tiny shift: i opened my eyes in the fog
and tore off the surfaces of 261 and 4 with a great shout.
