i laze about, deranged and unafraid
to godly kiss you, kiss the pharmacist
that whipped you, undilute, to dilate high
your animus of lime and lye.
i know of an upstairs hell.
a creamy, vascular thump
through bonus years of things that pass
and things that do not move. 
your cellular mouth. your mess
of inattention. now that none 
of us are good looking i think
that/they are right.
strokes of light you taped across my nipple.
patterns staked to fake the love
we cannot feel so slick the miser
of your hand through my bad heart.
genius, you are blond enough.
once in a while.
and in the end, when i sweep coolly up
and will not be drawn back,
then i will tell you of it. how i can.
in writing, i am making an attempt
to depict my beautiful nose
through imagery.
i will tell you of it. once in a while.
i will miss you. and the tape.
to be flung down,
petals from a balcony.
