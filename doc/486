cookies for sale!
and cake! one dime!
that's what it says
on my cardboard sign.
i pile cookies on a plate.
i eat just one
and then, i wait . . . 
i taste the cake
(one tiny slice)
i squeeze the lemons
and stir the ice;
i count and stack
the paper cups . . . 
fresh lemonade
is coming up!
i count the bruises
on my knee . . .
won't somebody buy something,
please?
