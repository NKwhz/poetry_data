                                                                     bangkok
 
 
caught in a slip of particulars,
say, between the dirt road
and the brand-new
 
 
                                                       seven-eleven, a bucket
                                                       of lotus, three shades of red
                                                       in the mudbank giving way to
 
 
workers, faces hidden
behind kerchiefs, binding
the copper tines of another
 
 
                                                      half-constructed building,
                                                      this fretwork, that rooftop’s
 
 
progress up and up, the eye riding
a motor’s rev, coming to
a woman who leans
 
 
                                                      over the seventh story’s edge
                                                      for the pulley rope’s
                                                      basket of rice or rubber mallets,
then a sweep down into
cattle now, their beige skin
over bones, the look of loose tents,
 
 
                                                      or taking in a bronze
                                                      buddha, hands folded over the first
 
 
national melting company,
the red gate, black gate,
red, retina arriving
 
 
                                                      at a man throwing straw
                                                      clumps to earth so the seeds
                                                      don’t wash away,
 
 
and the light behind him washing
away,
 
 
                                                      and this desire, a gaze
                                                      shot along the border which is
 
 
shaped like a question mark,
cramped with hotels, pink neon
 
 
                                                      grammars blinking
                                                      alpha, alpha, alpha is
 
 
the bank for you and your
needs, another quick catch,
 
 
                                                      the glance stippled
                                                      with disappearances,
 
 
a girl who lifts her skirt
to bathe near the bus stop,
 
 
                                                      a fire
                                                      burning/burnt/burning
                                                      in the field of bulldozers,
 
 
an eye trying to fix itself
as the vehicle turns,
 
 
                                                      the mind from
                                                      nascent to nation,
 
 
drifting in instances, a grit
in wind worrying
the surface, the facts,
 
 
                                                      out to finger the invisible
                                                      gap we would inhabit, pulsing always
                                                      in between.
