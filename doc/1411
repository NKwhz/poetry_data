moon has dusks for walls,
october’s days for a floor,
crickets for rooms, windy halls.
only one night is her door.
when i was thirteen she found me,
spiralled into my blood like a hive.
i stood on a porch where she wound me
for the first time, tight and alive,
till my body flooded to find her:
to know i would not be alone
as i moved through the tides that don't bind her
into womanhood, like a flung stone.
with each curve that waxed into fullness
i grew to her, ready and wild.
i filled myself up like her priestess.
i emptied myself like her child.
flooding, ready, and certain,
i hid her—full, fallow, or frail—
beneath each long summer's rich curtain.
it covered her face—the thin grail
that delivers me now. now i’m with her.
all cast shadows come home.
i stand in these shadows to kiss her;
i spin in her cool, calming storm.
now as i move through my own beauty
and my shadow grows deeper than blood,
oh triple, oh goddess, sustain me
with your light’s simple opening hood.
