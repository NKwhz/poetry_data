you who please      your keenness with poems,
read closely here:      can you discover
this verse’s framer?       finishes.
nobles enjoy it on earth,      but not without end,
worldly ones.      ﻿ must fail  
in our strongholds      once our bodies scatter
their loaned treasure,      like ﻿ trickling through fingers.
then ﻿ and ear      require ﻿ skill
in night’s narrow cell;      ﻿ drives your craft,
a kingly servitude.      now can you see
who shrewd words have      shown to men?
             remember my name,      o you who admire
the sound of this song;      help succor me
and pray for my comfort.      soon i must pass
alone, away      to look for a dwelling,
must travel so far      (no telling where!)
beyond this world      to a yet-unknown
place in the earth.      so must each person,
unless he is granted      god-sent grace.
            let us call to god      again, more eager,
begging his blessing      in this bright creation:
may we be welcomed      to his warm halls,
his home on high.      there is holiest happiness,
there the king of angels      crowns the pure
with a perishless prize.      now his praise endures
masterful and marvelous,      and his might extends
endless and ageless      over all creation.      finit.
