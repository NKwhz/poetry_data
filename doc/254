i have no idea what happens when i turn my back.
i sleep through everything.
it is quite stupid how i never open my eyes.
the carpet is luscious. the blossom at the window is spectacular.
i try to keep them apart.
there are more grown-ups than i know what to do with.
i have a different darling for each one. i inﬂect it.
i miss everything — the haunted wardrobe, the bald landlady,
the slurring woman crashing up and down the stairs,
look after her, look after her, pierrot with his little spoon.
