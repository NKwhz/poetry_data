try to remember: things go wrong in spite of it all.
i listen to our daughters singing in the crackling rows
of corn and wonder why i don't love them more.
they move like dark birds, small mouths open
to the sky and hungry. all afternoon i listen
to the highway and watch clouds push down over the hills.
i remember your legs, heavy with sleep, lying across mine.
i remember when the world was transparent, trembling, all
shattering light. i had to grit my teeth against its brilliance.
it was nothing like this stillness that makes it difficult
to lift my eyes. when i finally do, i see you
carrying the girls over the sharp stones of the creek bed.
when they pull at my clothes and lean against my arms,
i don't know what to do and do nothing.
