oh, yet we trust that somehow good
         will be the final end of ill,
         to pangs of nature, sins of will,
defects of doubt, and taints of blood;
that nothing walks with aimless feet;
         that not one life shall be destroy'd,
         or cast as rubbish to the void,
when god hath made the pile complete;
that not a worm is cloven in vain;
         that not a moth with vain desire
         is shrivell'd in a fruitless fire,
or but subserves another's gain.
behold, we know not anything;
         i can but trust that good shall fall
         at last—far off—at last, to all,
and every winter change to spring.
so runs my dream: but what am i?
         an infant crying in the night:
         an infant crying for the light:
and with no language but a cry.
