the mountain that remains when the universe is destroyed
is not big and is not small.
big and small are
comparative categories, and to what
could the mountain that remains when the universe is destroyed
be compared?
consciousness observes and is appeased.
the soul scrambles across the screes.
the soul,
like the square root of minus 1,
is an impossibility that has its uses.
