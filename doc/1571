as day did darken on the dewless grass,
there, still, wi’ nwone a-come by me
to stay a-while at hwome by me
within the house, all dumb by me,
i zot me sad as the eventide did pass.
an’ there a win’blast shook the rattlèn door,
an’ seemed, as win’ did mwoan without,
as if my jeäne, alwone without,
a-stannèn on the stwone without,
wer there a-come wi’ happiness oonce mwore.
i went to door; an’ out vrom trees above
my head, upon the blast by me,
sweet blossoms wer a-cast by me,
as if my love, a-past by me,
did fling em down—a token ov her love.
“sweet blossoms o’ the tree where i do murn,”
i thought, “if you did blow vor her,
vor apples that should grow vor her,
a-vallèn down below vor her,
o then how happy i should zee you kern!”
but no. too soon i voun my charm a-broke.
noo comely soul in white like her—
noo soul a-steppèn light like her—
an’ nwone o’ comely height like her
went by; but all my grief ageän awoke.
