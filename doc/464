i surrender my weapons:
catapult tears, rain-cloud hat,
lip zip, brittle coat, taut teeth
in guarded rows. pluck this plate
of armor from my ear, drop
it in the amnesty bin,
watch my sadness land among
the dark shapes of memory.
unarmed, now see me saunter
past ticking baggage, loaded
questions, gangs of doubt; my love
equips me. i swear, ever
since your cheeky face span round
i trust this whole bloody world.
