the people don't mention it much.
it goes without saying,
it stays without saying—
that concentration camp
on their reservation.
and they avoid that massive site
as they avoid contamination—
that massive void
punctuated by crusted nails,
punctured pipes, crumbled
failings of foundations . . .
what else is there to say?
this was a lush land once,
graced by a gifted people
gifted with the wisdom
of rivers, seasons, irrigation.
the waters went flowing
through a network of canals
in the delicate workings
of balances and health . . .
what else is there to say?
then came the nation.
then came the death.
then came the desert.
then came the camp.
but the desert is not deserted.
it goes without saying,
it stays without saying—
wind, spirits, tumbleweeds, pain.
