i do not know if, climbing some steep hill,
through fragrant wooded pass, this glimpse i bought,
or whether in some mid-day i was caught
to upper air, where visions of godâ€™s will
in pictures to our quickened sense fulfil
his word. but this i saw.
                                    a path i sought
through wall of rock. no human fingers wrought
the golden gates which opened sudden, still,
and wide. my fear was hushed by my delight.
surpassing fair the lands; my path lay plain;
alas, so spell-bound, feasting on the sight,
i paused, that i but reached the threshold bright,
when, swinging swift, the golden gates again
were rocky wall, by which i wept in vain.
