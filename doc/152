sheila, we speak here on the fly
leaf of a book which was myself
     a good few graves ago.
now i am maintained by other
words for better or for worse
     to whisper my hello.
the seasons turn. threshold on thresh
hold forms continually and falls
     under griefâ€™s lonely hammer.
what did you say? i thought between
these fly leaf words i heard you speak
     out of your second summer.
the summer chimes and turns its blue
dragon-flying eyes to see
     we two are not afraid.
hello, sheila, i can hear
your breath on the other side of the word
     and see you turn your head.
