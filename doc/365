i mean, who isn’t heating up for the next life
on the order of antoine doinel, or a pot of unsweetened chocolate.
beginning with a single window and the sense
that what we know outgrows everything except a headache
or the desk dreaming on its own. it doesn’t matter
if being upright brings living beings closer to
the lives they lead (one’s 26-year-old self smokes a cigar
but isn’t a desperado) nor is beginning a poem with
someone’s wrath a means of stepping outside the self
as though volume equalled flesh tones — any more than the epic
of the roast chicken with lyonnaise potatoes and greens
takes over the above-ground, colors and smells aside.
