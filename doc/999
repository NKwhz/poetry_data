the gooseberry’s no doubt an oddity,
an outlaw or pariah even—thorny
and tart as any
kindergarten martinet, it can harbor
like a fernseed, on its leaves’ under-
side, bad news for pine trees,
whereas the spruce
resists the blister rust
it’s host to. that veiny chinese
lantern, its stolid jelly
of a fruit, not only has
no aroma but is twice as tedious
as the wild strawberry’s sunburst
stem-end appendage: each one must
be between-nail-snipped at both extremities.
altogether, gooseberry virtues
take some getting
used to, as does trepang,
tripe à la mode de caen,
or having turned thirteen.
the acerbity of all things green
and adolescent lingers in
it—the arrogant, shrinking,
prickling-in-every-direction thorn-
iness that loves no company except its,
or anyhow that’s what it gets:
bristling up through gooseberry ghetto sprawl
are braced thistles’ silvery, militantly symmetrical
defense machineries. likewise inseparably en-
tangled in the disarray of an
uncultivated childhood, where gooseberry bushes (since
rooted out) once flourished, is
the squandered volupté of lemon-
yellow-petaled roses’ luscious flimflam—
an inkling of the mingling into one experience
of suave and sharp, whose supremely im-
probable and far-fetched culinary
embodiment is a gooseberry fool.
tomorrow, having stumbled into
this trove of chief ingredients
(the other being very thickest cream)
i’ll demonstrate it for you. ever since,
four summers ago, i first brought you,
a gleeful ariel, the trophy
of a small sour handful,
i’ve wondered what not quite articulated thing
could render magical
the green globe of an unripe berry.
i think now it was simply
the great globe itself’s too much to carry.
