there were scruffy local prophets
just beyond cannon-range
in every hamlet. door-hinge
guillem, say, in lebanon, oh — gets
no respect — or josh the carpenter,
for example, out on a limb
in galilee, ri. him
they tend to snub, until winter
cracks the mast off the yacht, &
the tub starts to founder
petrified in flounder-
nets (ocean’s cold reprimand).
time gets old, echoes grow faint;
the statue in the park
steps into evening dark,
amnesia puts on war-paint.
your icon, buried in the garden
sank like a thousand ships
into the grass. those lips
still graze my ear, sheep-warden —
whispering forgotten words
out of a lichen-book.
words of the sea. look,
their wave-trace in the woods —
a cedar replica. her milky kingdom
was a salt-spray splinter,
noah’s rudder-stump — her
shuddering shaker-wheel spelled freedom.
