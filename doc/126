light: lifted, i stretch my brief body.
color: blaze of day behind blank eyes.
sound: birds stab greedy beaks
into trunk and seed, spill husk
onto the heap where my dreaming
and my loving live.
every day i wake to this.
tracks follow the heavy beasts
back to where they huddle, herd.
hunt: a dance against hunger.
music: feast and fear.
this island becomes us.
trees cap our sky. it rustles with delight
in a voice green as lust. reptiles
drag night from their tails,
live by the dark. a rage of waves
protects the horizon, which we would devour.
one day i want to dive in and drift,
legs and arms wracked with danger.
like a dark star. i want to last.
