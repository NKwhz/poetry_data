out in the yard, my sister and i
tore thread from century plants
to braid into bracelets, ate
chalky green bananas,
threw coconuts onto the sidewalk
to crack their hard, hairy skulls.
 
the world had begun to happen,
but not time. we would live
forever, sunburnt and pricker-stuck,
our promises written in blood. not yet
 
would men or illness distinguish us,
our thoughts cleave us in two.
if she squeezed sour calamondins
into a potion, i drank it. when i jumped
from the fig tree, she jumped.
