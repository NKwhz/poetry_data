country people rise early
as their distant lights testify.
they don’t hold water in common. each house
has a personal source, like a bank account,
a stone vault. some share eggs,
some share expertise,
and some won’t even wave.
a walk for the mail elevates the heart rate.
last november i saw a woman down the road
walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange
cap to boot, a cautious soul.
bullets can’t read her no trespassing sign.
strange to think they’re in the air
like lead bees with a fatal sting.
our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen
with his rifle handy and the window open.
you never know when. once
he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill.
he’s in his seventies, born here, joined the navy,
came back. hard work never hurt a man
until suddenly he was another broken tool.
his silhouette against the dawn
droops as though drought-stricken, each step
deliberate, down the driveway to his black mailbox,
prying it open. checking a trap.
