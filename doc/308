what about those nosegays?! if you were to return
i would give you more, for all you have given us, for
your going first. those posies might have a
peony, a freesia, a tulip — an eye snack
and nostril snack, i could not get enough of
giving you coronation bundles, handing them
and almost bowing, tongue-tied with
respectful adoring, with gobbling
the sight of you the sound, the bouquets saying mother-
— we would not be here, without your song, your eye.
