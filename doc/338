but lake winds pick him up
& blow him into the clouds. i
married a dreamer. i wait. he
stops to listen to the early
lilac orchestra. he starts to

i thinksay remember. i remember us.
we chose the imaginal

between bartlett avenue and jupiter,
between lake michigan and

with us. remember that.
