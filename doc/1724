we sat across the table.
he said, cut off your hands.
they are always poking at things.
they might touch me.
i said yes.
food grew cold on the table.
he said, burn your body.
it is not clean and smells like sex.
it rubs my mind sore.
i said yes.
i love you, i said.
thatâ€™s very nice, he said
i like to be loved,
that makes me happy.
have you cut off your hands yet?
