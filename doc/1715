         i
under the makeshift arbor of leaves
a hot wind blowing smoke and laughter.
music out of the renegade west,
too harsh and loud, many dark faces
moved among the sweating whites.
         ii
wandering apart from the others,
i found an old indian seated alone
on a bench in the flickering shade.
he was holding a dented bucket;
three crayfish, lifting themselves
from the muddy water, stirred
and scraped against the greasy metal.
         iii
the old man stared from his wrinkled
darkness across the celebration,
unblinking, as one might see
in the hooded sleep of turtles.
a smile out of the ages of gold
and carbon flashed upon his face
and vanished, called away
by the sound and the glare around him,
by the lost voice of a child
piercing that thronged solitude.
         iv
the afternoon gathered distance
and depth, divided in the shadows
that broke and moved upon us . . .
slowly, too slowly, as if returned
from a long and difficult journey,
the old man lifted his bucket
and walked away into the sunlit crowd.
