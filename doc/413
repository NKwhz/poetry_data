our box henry hid    away.
john berryman’s ol’ henry sulked.
i see his point—he was trying to put one over.
it was that he thought that we thought
he could do it that breaks our henry out this-a-way.
so, here he will come out and talk.
 
all the world like a fool-bent lover
once did see from ol’ henry’s side.
here comes a departure:
hereafter, something falls out. now, it might go fraught.
let us see how box henry, pried
open for all to see, survives.
 
what he has now to say is a long
wonder the world can bear and see.
once, with his black-face worn, john was glad
all at the top. and he sang.
here, in this land where some strong be,
let box henry grow in every head.
