a town so flat a grave's a hill,
            a dusk the color of beer.
a row of schooldesks shadows fill,
            a row of houses near.
a courthouse spreading to its lawn,
            a bank clock's lingering heat.
a gleam of storefronts not quite gone,
            a courthouse in the street.
a different element, almost,
            a dry creek brimming black.
a light to lure the darkness close,
            a light to keep it back.
a time so still a heart's a sound,
            a moon the color of skin.
a pumpjack bowing to the ground,
            again, again, again.
