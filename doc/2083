all our roads go nowhere.
maps are curled
to keep the pavement definitely
on the world.
all our footsteps, set to make
metric advance,
lapse into arcs in deference
to circumstance.
all our journeys nearing space
skirt it with care,
shying at the distances
present in air.
blithely travel-stained and worn,
erect and sure,
all our travels go forth,
making down the roads of earth
endless detour.
