in the error
                             thinking of non-intervention
                                 with you. a red sun
                                     (donâ€™t look) pokes
                                through. staging
                             development and the cutting
                        loose of its facile integrity
                             its disproportionate
                                      personal non-response.
                                  the wince. the shrug. the
                                      belated semi-acknowledgment
                                           of owning just
                                                enough to take part.
                                  in the era, thinking of you
                                      will quit my job
                                               in one year to get
                                         more done, work harder
                                                to insert myself into
                                            the fragile extension
                                      of space between us
                                             to get something done.
                                                 in the ear
                                                     thinking after you.
