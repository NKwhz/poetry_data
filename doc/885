the screamer sleeps, inside.
the desert's wide awake:
the mouse, the rattlesnake.
i've come out here to hide,
behind our house, below
the riddled sky, afraid
of what our bodies made.
to the south: mexico...
these are the nights men run.
guaymas before midday,
a beach-town life...i play
it out. such things are done.
the rincons seep like a stain
into the paling east.
the borders are policed.
the wail, nearby, of a train.
