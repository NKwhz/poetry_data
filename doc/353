the twenty-fifth is imminent
and every known expedient
designed for making christmas pay
is getting swiftly under way.
observe the people swarming to
and fro, somnambulating through
the stores in search of ties and shirts
and gloves to give until it hurts.
they're eyeing gifts in saks' and hearn's 
and macy's, not to mention stern's,
while earnest copywriters are
hitching their copy to the star
of bethlehem quite shamelessly,
for they are duty bound to see
that peace on earth good will to men
gets adequate results again.
