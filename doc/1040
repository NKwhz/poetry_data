home from school at six years old, first grade,
and uncle there to tell me mommy
gone, mommy not be coming back any
 
time soon, liam, mommy had to go to
mental hospital. nervous breakdown.
years later mommy, when she gets out
 
of mental, often says, “if you’re
a bad boy for me liam you’re
going to send me back, back
 
into mental hospital, like you did
first time.” at 13
i find out mom had been doing years
 
in a federal prison all that time,
for stealing, so no mental hospital for
mommy. breakdown ours alone.
 
i was on my own.
