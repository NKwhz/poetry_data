this morning i was walking upstairs
from the kitchen, carrying your
beautiful flowers, the flowers you
 
brought me last night, calla lilies
and something else, i am not
sure what to call them, white flowers,
 
of course you had no way of knowing
it has been years since i bought
white flowers—but now you have
 
and here they are again. i was carrying
your flowers and a coffee cup
and a soft yellow handbag and a book
 
of poems by a chinese poet, in
which i had just read the words “come
or go but don’t just stand there
 
in the doorway,” as usual i was
carrying too many things, you
would have laughed if you saw me.
 
it seemed especially important
not to spill the coffee as i usually
do, as i turned up the stairs,
 
inside the whorl of the house as if
i were walking up inside the lilies.
i do not know how to hold all
 
the beauty and sorrow of my life.
