to discuss desalinization plants and de terroir
to date briefly a banker, a lapsed marxist, and hear him on the phone speaking in billions of dollars, its residue over the clear bulbs of his eyes, as he turns to look upon your nudity
to fantasize publishing a poem in the new yorker eviscerating his little need
to set a bell at each intellectual’s table setting ringing idea after idea, and be the simple-footed help, rushing to say yes?
to disrobe when the agent asks you to
to find a spot on any wall to stare into
to develop the ability to leave an entire nation thusly, just by staring at a spot on the wall
