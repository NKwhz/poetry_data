i am tired of people
combing their hair
and dripping in gold.
too much lacking the raw
of a natural fondness, and
i’m bloated with a craving;
pack
afewthings.
three times i’ve loved ya.
i am tired of wanting you.
of dressing myself.
of putting myself forth
at every spoonful of
cereal
or artificial glory.
i am rabid with a consciousness,
teeming with an illness
coagulated with thought,
buying your art
magazines
your red pants
your new soles.
porn is free!
did you know that?
porn is free.
