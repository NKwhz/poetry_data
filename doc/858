some feel rain. some feel the beetle startle
in its ghost-part when the bark
slips. some feel musk. asleep against
each other in the whiskey dark, scarcely there.
when it falls apart, some feel the moondark air
drop its motes to the patch-thick slopes of
snow. tiny blinkings of ice from the oak,
a boot-beat that comes and goes, the line of prayer
you can follow from the dusking wind to the snowy owl
it carries. some feel sunlight
well up in blood-vessels below the skin
and wish there had been less to lose.
knowing how it could have been, pale maples
drowsing like a second sleep above our temperaments.
do i imagine there is any place so safe it canâ€™t be
snapped? some feel the rivers shift,
blue veins through soil, as if the smokestacks were a long
dream of exhalation. the lynx lets its paws
skim the ground in snow and showers.
the wildflowers scatter in warm tints until
the second they are plucked. you can wait
to scrape the ankle-burrs, you can wait until mercury
the early star underdraws the night and its blackest
districts. and wonder. why others feel
through coal-thick night that deeply colored garnet
star. why sparring and pins are all you have.
why the earth cannot make its way towards you.
