in reality my loves
are the strange box of a polish doll
the blonde’s eyes appearing
fixed to her hips long after midnight
the garret always singular to loosen
a massive mane
across her back, its strands
thick and fine draping
her otter-like chin
deliberately she’d peer out from the wall
and nothing could be seen but the shadow of  her breasts
hidden beneath marmots of  hair
and lovely was her skin’s radiance
at that unusual hour
her waist’s digressions
easily discerned
as bees through grass
the window neither open nor closed
what i saw, yellow like crystal,
rose from sleepy thighs
amassed in unseemly tourniquets
everything before me, a pale shimmer
of  hairs fanning delicately
to reveal the pink or green skin i no longer know
of  hips a million centimeters
from my gaze.
