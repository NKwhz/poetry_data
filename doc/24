and although i am a poet, i am not the bullet;
i will not heat-search the soft points.
i am not the coroner who will graze her hand
over naked knees. who will swish her fingers
in the mouth. who will flip the body over, her eye a hook
fishing for government-issued lead.
i am not the sidewalk, which is unsurprised
as another cheek scrapes harsh against it.
             although i too enjoy soft palms on me;
enjoy when he rests on my body with a hard breath;
                                                                                 i have clasped
this man inside me and released him again and again,
listening to him die thousands of little deaths.
what is a good metaphor for a woman who loves in a time like this?
i am no scalpel or high thread count sheet. not a gavel, or hand-painted teacup.
i am neither           nor romanced by the streetlamp nor candlelight;
my hands are not an iron, but look, theyâ€™re hot, look
how i place them           in love           on his skin
and am still able to unwrinkle his spine.
