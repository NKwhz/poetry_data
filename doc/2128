if sunlight fell like snowflakes,
gleaming yellow and so bright,
we could build a sunman,
we could have a sunball fight,
we could watch the sunflakes
drifting in the sky.
we could go sleighing
in the middle of july
through sundrifts and sunbanks,
we could ride a sunmobile,
and we could touch sunflakesâ€”
i wonder how they'd feel.
