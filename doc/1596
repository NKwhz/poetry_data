i kissed a woman
whose freckles
aroused our neighbors.
her trembling lips
meant come to bed.
her hair falling down in the middle
of the conversation
meant come to bed.
i walked in my hospital of thoughts.
yes, i carried her off to bed
on the chair of my
hairy arms. but parted lips
meant kiss my parted lips,
i read those lips
without understanding
soft lips meant
kiss my soft lips.
such is a silence
of a woman who
speaks against silence, knowing
silence is what
moves us to speak.
