be like a bear in the forest of yourself.
even sleeping you are powerful in your breath.
every hair has life
and standing, as you do, swaying
from one foot to the other
all the forest stands with you.
each minute sound, one after another,
is distinct in your ear. here
in the blur of mixed sensations, you can
feel the crisp outline of being, particulate.
great as you are, huge as you are and
growling like the deepest drum,
the continual vibration that makes music
what it is,
not some light stone skipped on the surface of things,
you travel below
sounding the depths where only the dauntless go.
be like the bear and
do not forget
how you rounded your
massive shape over the just ripened
berry which burst
in your mouth that moment
how you rolled in
the wet grass, cool and silvery, mingling
with your sensate skin,
how you shut
your eyes and swam far and farther
still, starlight
shaping itself to your body,
starship rocking the grand, slow waves
under the white trees, in the
snowy night.
