well i recall my father’s wife,
      the day he brought her home.
his children looked for years of strife,
      and troubles sure to come—
ungraciously we welcomed her,
      a thing to scorn and blame;
and swore we never would confer
      on her, a mother’s name
i see her yet—a girl in years,
      with eyes so blue and mild;
she greeted us with smiles and tears,
      how sweetly too she smiled—
she bent to kiss my sullen brow,
      with woman’s gentle grace;
and laid her tiny hand of snow
      on my averted face—
“henry—is this your son? she said—
      “dear boy—he now is mine—
what not one kiss?—” i shook my head,
      “i am no son of thine!—”
she sighed—and from her dimpled cheek
      the rosy colour fled;
she turned away and did not speak,
      my thoughts were with the dead—
there leaped from out my father’s eyes
      a jet of swarthy fire;
that flashed on me in fierce surprise—
      i fled before his ire
i heard her gentle voice entreat—
      “forgiveness for her sake”—
which added swiftness to my feet,
      a sad and strange mistake—
a year had scarcely rolled away
      when by that hated bride;
i loved to linger half the day,
      in very joy and pride;
her voice was music to mine ear,
      so soft its accent fell;
“dear mother now”—and oh, how dear
      no words of mine can tell—
she was so gentle, fair and kind,
      so pure in soul and free from art;
that woman with her noble mind,
      subdued my rebel heart—
i just had learned to know her worth,
      my father’s second choice to bless;
when god removed her from the earth,
      and plunged us all in deep distress—
hot fever smote with burning blight
      stretchd on a restless bed of pain;
i moaning lay from morn till night
      with aching limbs and throbbing brain—
four weary weeks beside my bed,
      she sat within a darkened room;
untiring held my aching head,
      nor heeded silence—cold and gloom—
and when my courage quite gave way,
      and fainter grew my struggling breath;
she taught my stricken soul to pray
      and calmly meet approaching death—
“fear not god’s angel, sent by him,
      the weary spirit to release;
before the mortal eyes grow dim,
      floats down the white winged dove of peace”—
there came a change—but fingers small,
      no longer smoothed my matted hair;
she sprang not to my feeble call,
      nor helped to lift me to my chair—
and i arose as from the dead,
      a life for her dear life was given;
the angel who had watched my bed
      had vanished into heaven!—
