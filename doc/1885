since you dare brave me, with a rivals name,
you shall prevail, and i will quite my claime:
for know, proud maid, i scorn to call him mine,
whom thou durst ever hope to have made thine:
yet i confess, i lov’d him once so well,
his presence was my heav’n, his absence hell:
with gen’rous excellence i fill’d his brest,
and in sweet beauteous forms his person drest;
for him i did heaven, and its pow’r despise,
and onely lived by th’influence of his eyes:
i fear’d not rivals, for i thought that he
that was possess’d of such a prize as me,
all meaner objects wou’d contemn, and slight,
nor let an abject thing usurpe my right:
but when i heard he was so wretched base
to pay devotion to thy wrinkled face
i banish’t him my sight, and told the slave,
he had not worth, but what my fancy gave:
’twas i that rais’d him to this glorious state,
and can as easily annihilate:
but let him live, branded with guilt and shame,
and shrink into the shade from whence he came;
his punishment shall be, the loss of me,
and be augumented, by his gaining thee.
