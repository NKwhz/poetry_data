i don't want to be alive anymore.
i don't want to be alive enough to want that.
one is not meant to turn on one's creator
with ferocity expendable in only one way.
or is that exactly how one is meant to turn
to burn
 
beyond the love that from beyond being
has come to us:
christ's ever unhearable
and thus always too bearable
scream.
in love and dread we learn to listen
for beloved dread
coming upon us like a whiplash rain
we watch through a window.
in pain we learn pain.
sometimes amid the rancid moonlight and mindlice of my insomnia
there gleams a scalpel blade
so clean with meaning
so shaped and sharpened to interstellar blue
that drawing it —in season due —
across my own throat
there comes not blood but an ancient answering
starlight.
once upon a time in a pleasingly modern slaughterhospice
with a view of sky-contempted skyscrapers
and lake michigan's immaculate sewage
my inner skin was skinned mouth to bowels,
my soul —deadword, die to find it.
for self-pity there must remain a self.
ah, but even shitting one's self
one still finds one's self hastening to hide it all
from the kind ukranian nearly bearded night nurse.
fentanyl patches patching my stalactite thighs
my diaphanous shoulders
the very air eating me
like a late leaf
that once i would have flourished
for a perishable lover
or lonelied like some catpiss poignancy
into a poem.
dead brain, living will, little pills
entangling pain with adoration of it,
morphine machine whose little beep
(heavenly bell)
conjures me to the suddenly more tolerable hallways
of hell . . .
                         lovely leila,
so unsurgically curved,
disclosing as she leans to clean my lines
a bit of icelace undergarment like the very last trace
of a glacier.
the brain the brain the brain flickering electrically
in and out,
 in,
          out—
not the mind in which i love
my wife
whose tightwound nightmind conjures christ in diapers,
for instance, filthy infant, or later,
in a mist of adolescent bad weather,
bored of wood, dogdead judea, squawk-box god,
some restless absurdity of earth, she says,
through which the rest of heaven can come.
once upon a time i walked through the chemical glamour
of a night refinery
sparking dangerously without and within
for beside me under her underclothes
undulated an incarnation
of creation's finest failure:
moonskin to make a young man wince
coupled with stifling innocence.
still, we managed.
and over the wrought-iron railing of the country club
to which neither of us could possibly belong,
in the moonskinned pool that seemed both to embody and imbibe
her, we improved.
and later, out on a green (to be sixteen!)
when the starshower i thought was mine
was mining me for sweat, muscle, memory
to make its own death
shine unceasingly inside of me,
even unto hell,
                               we excelled.
can it be that her last name was really key?
so much life in this poem
so much salvageable and saving love
but it is i fear i swear i tear open
what heart i have left
to keep it from being
and beating and bearing down upon me

what rest in faith
wrested
               from grief
what truce
             with truth
in bowing
down
not to the ground
of being
               but simply
to the ground
affliction flickers
distant
               now
like a structure
on fire
              love's
reprieve
moves through me
like a breeze
but antlike
             existence
crawls all over me lord
and i cry out
if you call
             this vise
quiet
              a cry
this riot
of needs and genes
an i
feelingly
             among the
bones
              and nerves
of sounds
i make my scathing
way
             failingly
in church
or in the parked
car
             before work
i try
              to pray
what might it mean
to surrender
              to the wonder
nothing
                means
 
not to end
              with a little flourish
                            of earth
not to end

something in us suffering touches,
teaches first to find
little coves in our loves: blank nothings
wherein we are what we always were
              — blank nothings —
but changed or rearranged
as atoms
               in the random
                             kingdom
                                           of things:
hand, we say, or eye, or hair,
as if to make ourselves — to stake ourselves — truly
there
knowing now not to move in time
we are moved
                        by tiger-striped tails
bloodfine fins
some natureless cerulean
one would say
thinking oneself
out of nature
something in us, suffering, touches,
torches,
               so we may saunter
seeingly
through an altogether other
element,
as once in the shedd aquarium in chicago
                i floated    a moment
with my love and the two new lives
borne from us
                           who loved best
the eensy
                  green
                               almost
                                              unfish
more like the stars
when you close your eyes and whirl
open to the whirling
grains
so freed from things
                                        you fall
                                                      down
                                                                 laughing
at the havoc
for me for a long time
not the minnows mattered
but the pattern after: miraculous
i didn't think
to think:
all those mite-eyes and animate instants
answering at once to my need
and to nothing
as if my very nerves worked
in finally a saving sense
something in us touches
suffering
                  touching
us
like the constellations
of kinetic quiet
that bound us beyond us
as right to the wall the girls pressed
their still-forming faces
through which the wild new schools flew
                                                          almost
                                           too green
                             too blue
               to stand
and i held your hand.
