"there's machinery in the butterfly;
there's a mainspring to the bee;
there's hydraulics to a daisy,
and contraptions to a tree.
"if we could see the birdie
that makes the chirping sound
with x-ray, scientific eyes,
we could see the wheels go round."
and i hope all men
who think like this
will soon lie
underground.
