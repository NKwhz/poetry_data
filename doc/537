okay part of it’s
here. see it,
i want you to see my brother, dead smiling
in a red short-sleeved shirt,
you look so much better
i got through.
  how does time work for you?
i can see where — when — i felt bad.
goes past. i’m not in it any more
but this change hasn’t happened in time — a kind of
before and after but no ... continuum.
you look brilliant! i
never let you down — he says — did i?
it wasn’t possible,          why not?
sisters and brothers are loyal,
we are the primal particles.
i saw how we connected to make a shape
in the eyes of the beholder who chose it: but we
are not that. what i see is free to change its outline.
my story: the shadow of one. why did i
shrink into a story? it’s easier to talk
as a person, but why? i guess we decided to, talking.
