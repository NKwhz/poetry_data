a minor brush with medicine
         in eighty years was all
         he’d known.
                             but this was different.
his right arm limp and slung,
         his right leg dead to feeling
         and response, he let me spoon him
         chicken-broth.
                                 later he said
         without self-pity that he’d like
         to die.
                   i bluffed, “the doctors
         think that therapy might help you
         walk again.”
                             “they’re liars,
         all of them,” he muttered.
                                                  bedfast
         was never how he hoped to go.
“in bed you think of everything,”
         he whispered with a shrug, “you think
         of all your life.”
                                   i knew
         he meant my mother.
                                           without her
         he was never what he might have been,
         and everyone who knew him knew it.
nothing could take her place—
         not the cars he loved to drive,
         not the money he could earn at will,
         not the roads he knew by heart
         from florida to saranac, not the two
         replacement wives who never
         measured up.
                             fed now by family
         or strangers, carried to the john,
         shaved and changed by hired help,
         this independent man turned silent
         at the end.
                          only my wife
         could reach him for his private needs.
what no one else could do
         for him, he let her do.
she talked to him and held
         his hand, the left.
                                     she helped him
         bless himself and prayed beside him
         as my mother might have done.
“darling” was his final word
         for her.
                      softly, in arabic.
