promises to keep was a lie, he had nothing. through 
the woods. over the river and into the pain. it is an addict's
talk of quitting as she's smacking at a vein. he was always
going into the woods. it was he who wrote, the best way
out is always through. you'd think a shrink, but no, a poet.
he saw the woods and knew. the forest is the one that holds
promises. the woods are lovely, dark, and deep, they fill 
with a quiet snow. miles are traveled as we sleep. he steers
his horse off the road. among the trees now, the blizzard 
is a dusting. holes in the canopy make columns of snowstorm, 
lit from above. his little horse thinks it is queer. they go
deeper, sky gets darker. it's the darkest night of the year.

he had no promises to keep, nothing pending. had no bed
to head to, measurably away in miles. he was a freak like me,
monster of the dawn. whose woods these are i think i know,
his house is in the village though. in the middle of life
he found himself lost in a dark woods. i discovered myself
in a somber forest. in between my breasts and breaths i got
lost. the woods are lovely, dark and deep. but i've got promises
to keep, smiles to go before i leap. i'm going into the woods.
they're lovely dark, and deep, which is what i want, deep lovely 
darkness. no one has asked, let alone taken, a promise of me,
no one will notice if i choose bed or rug, couch or forest deep. 
it doesn't matter where i sleep. it doesn't matter where i sleep.
