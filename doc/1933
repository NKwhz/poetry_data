enormous solids were falling
from who knows what heights,
who knows what places.
i trembled,
and in my mouth
an inky taste. precise.
hail, maybe,
enormous kernels of ice;
coming down,
with a scandalous impact,
didn't bury me, terrorized,
under the covers.
it didn't happen, it wasn't that.
a below zero temperature   
circulated through the soft center of my bones.
a truly searing cold.   
nothing having to do with monsters came to pass.
nothing to do with interminable distances.
no brutal incidents.
only the agony of acorns.
only a cycle that completes itself
every few years
and transforms into a tropical forest
a choiring oak grove.   
which is the fear.
