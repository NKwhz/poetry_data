 
if the butterfly courted the bee,    
  and the owl the porcupine;    
if churches were built in the sea,    
  and three times one was nine;    
if the pony rode his master,          
  if the buttercups ate the cows,    
if the cats had the dire disaster    
  to be worried, sir, by the mouse;    
if mamma, sir, sold the baby    
  to a gypsy for half a crown;         
if a gentleman, sir, was a lady,—    
  the world would be upside-down!    
if any or all of these wonders    
  should ever come about,    
i should not consider them blunders,          
  for i should be inside-out!    
 
            chorus
ba-ba, black wool,    
  have you any sheep?    
yes, sir, a packfull,    
  creep, mouse, creep!         
four-and-twenty little maids    
  hanging out the pie,    
out jump’d the honey-pot,    
  guy fawkes, guy!    
cross latch, cross latch,      
  sit and spin the fire;    
when the pie was open’d,    
  the bird was on the brier!
