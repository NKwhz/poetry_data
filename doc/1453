the body is a nation i have not known.
the pure joy of air: the moment between leaping
from a cliff into the wall of blue below. like that.
or to feel the rub of tired lungs against skin-
covered bone, like a hand against the rough of bark.
like that. “the body is a savage,” i said.
for years i said that: the body is a savage.
as if this safety of the mind were virtue
not cowardice. for years i have snubbed
the dark rub of it, said, “i am better, lord,
i am better,” but sometimes, in an unguarded
moment of sun, i remember the cowdung-scent
of my childhood skin thick with dirt and sweat
and the screaming grass.
but this distance i keep is not divine,
for what was christ if not god’s desire
to smell his own armpit? and when i
see him, i know he will smile,
fingers glued to his nose, and say, “next time
i will send you a down as a dog
to taste this pure hunger.”
