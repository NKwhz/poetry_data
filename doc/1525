“oh! for a thousand tongues to sing
   my great redeemer’s praise:
the glories of my lord and king,
   the triumphs of his grace.”
oh! for a thousand cedar posts
   to fence my garden ’round.
to hinder the neighbors’ pigs and goats
   from rooting up my potato ground.
oh! for a thousand hickory rails,
   to make my fence secure;
a thousand patent locks and keys,
   to lock my stable door.
oh! for a thousand bricks and stones,
   to build my chimney higher,
to keep the neighbors’ boys and girls
   from putting out my fire.
oh! for a thousand old shot guns,
   that i might be a match,
for all the tramps that i can find
   in my watermelon patch.
oh! for a thousand pumpkin seeds,
   to plant for my son john;
he says that pumpkin pies are good
   when the winter time comes on.
oh! for a thousand cribs of corn,
   filled chuck up to the beam;
and a thousand pails that’s good and strong,
   to keep the milk and cream.
oh! for a thousand turnip bads,
   placed all into a row;
lord! please send a little rain,
   to make the ’tatoes grow.
oh! for a thousand tongues to ask
   my maker, who’s on high,
to keep my smoke-house filled with meal,
   fat bacon, rock and rye.
now, lord, i close my humble prayer,
   which (to some) may seem a vision;
numbers ask for all i’ve named,
   whilst few ask for religion.
