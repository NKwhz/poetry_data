—in borrowed language in honor and memory of bill ice
 
 
like a horse’s tail
so thick, black
down past his waist
beautiful.    wanyaka.
chemotherapy—
white man’s
man-made cancer . . .
doesn’t distinguish
between good or bad
cells . . . just kills.
the spirit is connected
to the hair at the
crown—pahin hocoka.
the hair falls
the spirit goes,
the will is
connected no more.
leukemia—
cancer of the
white
blood cell.
