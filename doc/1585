to our land,
and it is the one near the word of god,
a ceiling of clouds
to our land,
and it is the one far from the adjectives of nouns,
the map of absence
to our land,
and it is the one tiny as a sesame seed,
a heavenly horizon ... and a hidden chasm
to our land,
and it is the one poor as a grouse’s wings,
holy books ... and an identity wound
to our land,
and it is the one surrounded with torn hills,
the ambush of a new past
to our land, and it is a prize of war,
the freedom to die from longing and burning
and our land, in its bloodied night,
is a jewel that glimmers for the far upon the far
and illuminates what’s outside it ...
as for us, inside,
we suffocate more!
