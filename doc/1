chapter viii
tired    i walk toward everything except fear
over seaweed-covered rocks
i think that someday some new women
will be allowed to see each other happy
happy more than usual
i looked in all the other open rooms of my heart
a vague fear obscured the whole scene into a diorama of ruin
as sharp as a sword-cut    the light struck    a half-reclining cloud
time and distance trembled in my body
  •
to become in love with everything apropos of nothing
to see without seeming to stare
to change in the reflection
to appear peculiar
  •
we never refer to sadness
as something that looks
like secrecy
but it does
  •
i drifted on the fresh breeze
i did not like it
joy     joy     joy although not joy    a bad thing
i can feel it wet against my bosom
my journey is mapped and ready
i am only taking one dress
  •
i don’t want to talk     of infinitesimal distinctions
between man and man     see no difference     between men and maidens
i am the modern morpheus
i made the minutes disappear
i am thin
an errant swarm of bees
a naked lunatic
faithful
selfish
old
a tiger
immensely strong
a wild beast
a paroxysm of rage
mercy
murder
coming
coming
coming
  chapter xiv
after a bad night i lock myself in my room and read
i had only imagination
i remember how on our wedding day    he said
i shall never let trouble or nervousness concern you    you can trust me
i must not forgive    i cannot    
i know the real truth now
my imagination tinges everything with ill adventure
i suppose a cry clears the air    as other rain does
  •
i have a good memory for details
it is not always so with young ladies    or so it had been said to me
i cannot comprehend this husband
women all their lives are interrupted    considered hysterical
summoned to make children for the strong and manly
and for his sake must smile and not speak
now this man i began to think a weak fool
i had trusted him    my husband
even half believed his words when he said
i would have an ordinary life    without dread
  •
let me tell you from experience of men
his brain and heart are terrible things
this man    impotent in the dark
he succeeded in getting me to doubt
everything took a hue of unreality
i did not trust even my own senses
you don’t know what it is to doubt everything    even yourself
i am a wife he fashioned by his own hand
to be sweet and earnest and so kind
  •
an idea struck me
following great loss     people see things that others cannot
men want to explain explain explain
see themselves new    pretend to be young
ladies’ bodies are deemed unholy
by the very men who burn them
generations of men believe that women
walk amongst them without knowledge
my thesis is this
i want to believe    to believe    
to believe in
a universe    willing
to understand
  chapter xxi
a detail in a pool of blood
the body gathered in an awkward kink
i dress myself  in easy anything
  •
i softened into a swollen confusion
only slightly solid    i was shining
he beckoned
his hands    a dark mass like a thousand rats
a cloud closed over my eyes
i moistened myself with brandy
i held tight to life
i became like water
  •
kneeling on the edge of the bed    his face was turned
his left hand    held both arms    his right gripped
my neck    blood    a thin stream of it    his nostrils quivered
  •
i lay in disarray
my eyes    and from them came    an endless moment
cold moonshine dazed me    i began to pull on clothes
i drew back    unclean
shame folded me like steel    tried to twist me in obedience
i could not feel the rise of reddening dawn
silence    the sound of  what happened
  •
i want you to know all this
understand    how much i need to show you
it was he who caused me to disappear
my husband    my husband and other men
hunt me and command    my flesh my blood my brain
this is my pollution story
  •
the eastern sky became clear
             as the awful narrative deepened
                          in the morning light
                                       when the first red streak shot up my flesh
