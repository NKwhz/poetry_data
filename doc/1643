when the sun’s whiteness closes around us
like a noose,
it is noon, and molina squats
in the uneven shade of an oleander.
he unfolds a map and, with a pencil,
blackens panama
into a bruise;
he dots rain over bogotá, the city of spiders,
and x’s in a mountain range that climbs
like a thermometer
above the stone fence
the old never thought to look over.
a fog presses over lima.
brazil is untangled of its rivers.
where there is a smudge,
snow has stitched its cold into the field.
where the river orinoco cuts east,
a new river rises nameless
from the open grasses,
and molina calls it his place of birth.
