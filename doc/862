the room i entered was a dream of   this room.
surely all those feet on the sofa were mine.
the oval portrait
of   a dog was me at an early age.
something shimmers, something is hushed up.
we had macaroni for lunch every day
except sunday, when a small quail was induced
to be served to us. why do i tell you these things?
you are not even here.
