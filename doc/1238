in the dark irritation of the eyes there is a snake hiding
in the exhalations of americans there is a crumbling empire
in the foul waters of the rivers there are palestinians
out out of its borders pain has a leash on its neck
in the wheat stalks there are insects vaccinated against bread
in the arabian boats there are sharks shaken with laughter
in the camel’s belly there are blind highways
out out of time there is spring’s shattered hope
in the deluge on our plains there are no rains but stones
