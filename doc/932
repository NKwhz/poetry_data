i will not tend. or water,
pull, or yank,
i will not till, uproot,
 
fill up or spray.
 
the rain comes.
or not. plants: sun-fed,
moon-hopped, dirt-stuck.
 
watch as flocks
of wild phlox
 
appear, disappear. my lazy,
garbagey magic
makes this nothing
happen.
 
i love
the tattered
camisole of
nothing. the world
runs its underbrush
course fed by
the nothing i give it.
 
wars are fought.
blood turns.
dirt is a wide unruly room.
