down by the salley gardens
   my love and i did meet;
she passed the salley gardens
   with little snow-white feet.
she bid me take love easy,
   as the leaves grow on the tree;
but i, being young and foolish,
   with her would not agree.
in a field by the river
   my love and i did stand,
and on my leaning shoulder
   she laid her snow-white hand.
she bid me take life easy,
   as the grass grows on the weirs;
but i was young and foolish,
   and now am full of tears.
