to those fair isles where crimson sunsets burn,
we send a backward glance to gaze on thee,
brave toussaint! thou was surely born to be
a hero; thy proud spirit could but spurn
each outrage on the race. couldst thou unlearn
the lessons taught by instinct? nay! and we
who share the zeal that would make all men free,
must e’en with pride unto thy life-work turn.
soul-dignity was thine and purest aim;
and ah! how sad that thou wast left to mourn
in chains ’neath alien skies. on him, shame! shame!
that mighty conqueror who dared to claim
the right to bind thee. him we heap with scorn,
and noble patriot! guard with love thy name.
