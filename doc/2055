shall i say how it is in your clothes?
a month after your death i wear your blue jacket.   
the dog at the center of my life recognizes   
you’ve come to visit, he’s ecstatic.
in the left pocket, a hole.
in the right, a parking ticket
delivered up last august on bay state road.   
in my heart, a scatter like milkweed,
a flinging from the pods of the soul.
my skin presses your old outline.
it is hot and dry inside.
i think of the last day of your life,
old friend, how i would unwind it, paste   
it together in a different collage,
back from the death car idling in the garage,   
back up the stairs, your praying hands unlaced,   
reassembling the bits of bread and tuna fish   
into a ceremony of sandwich,
running the home movie backward to a space   
we could be easy in, a kitchen place
with vodka and ice, our words like living meat.
dear friend, you have excited crowds
with your example. they swell
like wine bags, straining at your seams.   
i will be years gathering up our words,   
fishing out letters, snapshots, stains,
leaning my ribs against this durable cloth
to put on the dumb blue blazer of your death.
