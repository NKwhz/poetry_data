everyone suddenly burst out singing;
and i was filled with such delight
as prisoned birds must find in freedom,
winging wildly across the white
orchards and dark-green fields; on - on - and out of sight.
everyone's voice was suddenly lifted;
and beauty came like the setting sun:
my heart was shaken with tears; and horror
drifted away ... o, but everyone
was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.
