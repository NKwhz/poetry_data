when i see the cradle rocking
what is it that i see?
i see a rood on the hilltop
        of calvary.
when i hear the cattle lowing
what is it that they say?
they say that shadows feasted
        at tenebrae.
when i know that the grave is empty,
absence eviscerates me,
and i dwell in a cavernous, constant
        horror vacui.
