roger a doleful widower,
full eighteen weeks had been,
when he, to meet the milk-maid nell
came smiling o’er the green.
blithe as a lad of seventeen,
he thus accosted nell;
give me your pail, i’ll carry it
for you, if you think well.
says nell, indeed my milking-pail
you shall not touch, i vow;
i’ve carried it myself before,
and i can carry it now.
so side by side they walked awhile,
then he at last did say;
my inclination is to come
and see you, if i may.
nell understood his meaning well,
and briskly answered she;
you may see me at any time,
if you look where i be.
says he, but hear me yet awhile,
i’ve something more to tell;
i gladly would a sweetheart be
unto you, mistress nell.
a sweetheart i don’t want, says nell,
kind sir, and if you do,
another you may seek, for i
am not the lass for you.
when she had made him this reply,
he’d nothing more to say
but — nelly, as good night to you,
and homeward went his way.
