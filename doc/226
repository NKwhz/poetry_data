the dry basin of the moon must have held
the bones of a race, radiant minerals,
or something devoid of genesis, angel-heavy,
idea-pure. all summer we had waited for it,
 
our faces off-blue in front of the tv screen.
nothing could be more ordinary—two figures
digging dirt in outer space—while mother repeated
neil armstrong’s words, like a prayer
 
electronically conveyed. the dunes were lit
like ancient silk, like clandestine pearl.
in the constant lunar night this luminescence
was all we hoped for. a creature unto itself,
 
it poured into the room like a gradual flood
of lightning, touching every object with the cool burn
of something not quite on fire. if we stepped out
manila would be blank ether, way station,
 
a breathless abeyance. it didn’t matter,
at that moment, where our lives would lead:
father would disown one brother,
one sister was going to die. not yet unhappy,
 
we were ready to walk on the moon. reckless
in our need for the possible, we knew
there was no turning back, our bags already packed,
the future a religion we could believe in.
