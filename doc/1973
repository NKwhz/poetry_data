as if the moon could haul through you
its tremor of light and stone,
be cleared of sound. plough
the mind's noise until it's a shine
in the purl of south-bending river that bears
itself toward a blacker part of the forest.
if you hum, hum through the motes of air,
perhaps your nerves will find at last
a tone to which they will succumb.
be still. be not so heavy-hearted
for a moment. all is not a tomb,
blind sarcophagus staring dumb, thwarted
pleasures nailed inside. these fireflies
sweep their tracings on the evening.
weep if you must, but board what falls
away, abdomens flaringâ€”
the brief, nomadic intervals.
