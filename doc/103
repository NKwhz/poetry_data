when my father died, he left me a trove
           of video tapes, a warped memorial
for those men he watched with my mother
           before she left for parts unknown,
for those fights he relived once he was laid
           off from the plane yards. we watched
men like sputnik monroe bleed the hard way,
           shook our fists as he broke rules
against guys who were easier to cheer.
           he was a bad elvis, greased-back
hair with a shock of white, sputnik monroe
           mixed it up everywhere, a rodeo
fistfight, a henhouse tornado. my mother
           picked a fight in an idaho truck stop
once, stabbed a man’s chest with her middle
           finger, then stepped to one side
so my father could fight him in the parking lot.
           afterwards, my mother was silent
all the way back to seattle, her disgust
           with him—the way he wrapped his arm
around her shoulder, guided her to the car,
           and sped back to the freeway—hanging
between them from that point forward.
           sputnik monroe clobbered men
wherever he went, sneered at those fists
           raised against him in memphis.
some nights, as my wife sleeps upstairs,
           i watch my father’s video tapes and
imagine what i would have done that day
           if i knew that my marriage depended
on what i did with my hands.
