the letter a is awesome!
it simply is the best.
without an a, you could not get
an a+ on a test.
you’d never see an acrobat
or eat an apple pie.
you couldn’t be an astronaut
or kiss your aunt goodbye.
an antelope would not exist.
an ape would be unknown.
you’d never hear a person
say “afraid” or “all alone”.
the a’s in avocado
would completely disappear
and certain words would be forgot
like “ankle”, “arm”, and “ear”.
 
without the a, you couldn’t aim
an arrow in the air.
you wouldn’t ask for apricots
or almonds at a fair.
aruba and australia
would be missing from a map.
you’d never use an atm,
an apron, or an app.
the arctic fox and aardvark
would be absent from the zoo,
and vowels, as you know them,
would be e, i, o, and u.
there wouldn’t be an a chord
on the instruments you play.
let’s appreciate, admire,
and applaud the letter a!
