i've already grown a goiter from this torture,
hunched up here like a cat in lombardy
(or anywhere else where the stagnant water's poison).
my stomach's squashed under my chin, my beard's
pointing at heaven, my brain's crushed in a casket,
my breast twists like a harpy's. my brush,
above me all the time, dribbles paint
so my face makes a fine floor for droppings!
my haunches are grinding into my guts,
my poor ass strains to work as a counterweight,
every gesture i make is blind and aimless.
my skin hangs loose below me, my spine's
all knotted from folding over itself.
i'm bent taut as a syrian bow.
because i'm stuck like this, my thoughts
are crazy, perfidious tripe:
anyone shoots badly through a crooked blowpipe.
my painting is dead.
defend it for me, giovanni, protect my honor.
i am not in the right placeâ€”i am not a painter.
