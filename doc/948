is my heart. a stranger
berry there never was,
tartless.
 
gone sour in the sun,
in the sunroom or moonroof,
roofless.
 
no poetry. plain. no
fresh, special recipe
to bless.
 
all iâ€™ve ever made
with these hands
and life, less
 
substance, more rind.
mostly rim and trim,
meatless
 
but making much smoke
in the old smokehouse,
no less.
 
fatted from the day,
overripe and even
toxic at eve. nonetheless,
 
in the end, if you must
know, if i must bend,
waistless,
 
to that excruciation.
no marvel, no harvest
left me speechless,
 
yet i find myself
somehow with heart,
aloneless.
 
with heart,
fighting fire with fire,
fightless.
 
that loud hub of us,
meat stub of us, beating us
senseless.
 
spectacular in its way,
its way of not seeing,
congealing dayless
 
but in everydayness.
in that hopeful haunting
(a lesser
 
way of saying
in darkness) there is
silencelessness
 
for the pressing question.
heart, what art you?
war, star, part? or less:
 
playing a part, staying apart
from the one who loves,
loveless.
