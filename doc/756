the house is crammed: tier beyond tier they grin 
and cackle at the show, while prancing ranks 
of harlots shrill the chorus, drunk with din; 
“we’re sure the kaiser loves the dear old tanks!”
 
i’d like to see a tank come down the stalls, 
lurching to rag-time tunes, or “home, sweet home,” 
and there'd be no more jokes in music-halls 
to mock the riddled corpses round bapaume.
