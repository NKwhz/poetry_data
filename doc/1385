it’s true i never write, but i would gladly die with you.
gladly lower myself down alone with you into the enormous mouth
that waits, beyond youth, beyond every instant of ecstasy, remember:
before battle we would do each other’s makeup, comb each other’s
                   hair out
saying we are unconquerable, we are terrible and splendid—
the mouth waiting, patiently waiting. and i will meet you there
                   again
beyond bleeding thorns, the endless dilation, the fire that alters
                   nothing;
i am there already past snowy clouds, balding moss, dim
swarm of stars even we can step over, it is easier this time, i promise—
i am already waiting in your personal heaven, here is my hand,
i will help you across. i would gladly die with you still,
although i never write  
from this gray institution. see
they are so busy trying to cure me,
i’m condemned—sorry, i have been given the job
of vacuuming the desert forever, well, no more than eight hours
                   a day.
and it’s really just about a thousand miles of cafeteria;
a large one in any event. with its miniature plastic knives,
its tuna salad and saran-wrapped genitalia will somebody
                   please
get me out of here, sorry. i am happy to say that
every method, massive pharmaceuticals, art therapy
and edifying films as well as others i would prefer
not to mention—i mean, every single technique
known to the mouth—sorry!—to our most kindly
compassionate science is being employed
to restore me to normal well-being
and cheerful stability. i go on vacuuming
toward a small diamond light burning
off in the distance. remember
me. do you
remember me?   
in the night’s windowless darkness
when i am lying cold and numb
and no one’s fiddling with the lock, or
shining flashlights in my eyes,
although i never write, secretly
i long to die with you,
does that count?
