i woke. a tiny knot of skin on a silver table
set in the birth-theater, blinking in the glare
of electric lights and a strange arranged
 
passel of faces: huge as gods in their council.
i was the actor who forgets his lines and enters
on stage suddenly wanting to say, i am.
 
i was almost all eye: they weighed me down,
two lump-big brown-sugar bags in a face
which did not yet know struggle, burden;
 
how the look of newborns unnerves. then
they wrapped me in pale yellow like a new sun
still too small to throw up into the sky.
 
 
              it was midnight when they injected me
with a plague; tamed, faded as imperialism, pox
had once put its palm-leaf hand over a quarter of earth
 
saying, these. now it was contracted to a drop:
and in the morning i knew both death and life.
lapped in my nimbus of old gold light, my
 
huge lashes drooped over my deepened eyes, like
ostrich-feather shades over twin crown princes: wet heads
sleek and doomed as the black soul of an open poppy.
