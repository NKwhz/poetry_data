spring pricks a little. i get out the maps.
time to demoralize my song, high time.
vernal a little. primavera. first
green, first truth and last.
high time, high time.
 
a high old time we had of it last summer?
i overstate. but getting out the maps…
look! up the valley of the brenne,
louise de la vallière… syntax collapses.
high time for that, high time.
 
to château-renault, the tannery town whose marquis
rooke and james butler whipped in vigo bay
or so the song says, an amoral song
like ronsard’s where we go today
perhaps, perhaps tomorrow.
 
tomorrow and tomorrow and… get well!
philip’s black-sailed familiar, avaunt
or some word as ridiculous, the whole
diction kit begins to fall apart.
high time it did, high time.
 
high time and a long time yet, my love!
get out that blessed map.
ageing, you take your glasses off to read it.
stooping to truth, we potter to montoire.
high time, my love. high time and a long time yet.
