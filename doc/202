it is not like going to the bank.
 
there are no hard candies in a basket made in china,
and no kleenexes on the counter.
there is no refund if someone forgets to wish you a good day.
 
there are no chairs for the aged,
no toys for two-year-olds with earaches,
no supervisor to speak to in case of the
absurd.
 
there are no meal vouchers if it takes all day,
no list of local hotels with a negotiated rate.
no one wants to know if you are a doctor.
 
plastic is not magic. seals are not signs.
your cousin-brotherâ€™s wedding is not relevant.
hell, there is no such thing as a cousin-brother.
 
and it is always your fault: not enough planning,
the wrong color passport, the misplaced stress
in a word.
