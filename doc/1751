all greece hates   
the still eyes in the white face,   
the lustre as of olives   
where she stands,   
and the white hands.   
all greece reviles   
the wan face when she smiles,   
hating it deeper still   
when it grows wan and white,   
remembering past enchantments   
and past ills.   
greece sees unmoved,   
godâ€™s daughter, born of love,   
the beauty of cool feet   
and slenderest knees,   
could love indeed the maid,   
only if she were laid,   
white ash amid funereal cypresses.
