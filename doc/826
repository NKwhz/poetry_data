they tilt their guitars and stare.
each boy puts one foot toward
us, one where a trailing wire
would run to an amplifier
if amplifiers were there.
bill's gibson glitters like ore.
kenny's iba√±ez hoards
white noise in its black fretboard.
bill's double chin shows. is it fair
to mention his pudge? kenny's hair
gets stuck behind one ear.
each of the brothers wears
a t-shirt, loose jeans, and a pair
of bruised high-tops. a pear-
shaped garbage bag hugs a steel bar.
the big rectangular blur
behind them looks like the door
to a walk-in refrigerator.
maybe dad is a restaurateur,
a diner owner who requires
kenny to spend six hours
a week moving cases of beer,
while bill chops potatoes, or scours
grease from the checkerboard floor.
bill imagines a national tour:
cbgb's. the black cat. hardcore.
or metal: the glow and allure
of arenas and open-air
pyrotechnics at dusk, a chauffeur.
or do they hope modestly for
sideman jobs, l.a. 'burbs, the secure
work of studio engineers?
two boys hold two guitars
in a basement kitchen, and care
what you think of them. next year
they promise to practice more.
right now their repertoire
is six songs, seven chords,
five originals, and a spare
reworking of rem's four-
minute anthem about a lost car:
"can't get there from here."
