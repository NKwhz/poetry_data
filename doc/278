this is the sound of the bell. it rings,
full of brass and the end it brings:
once for the children, once for the child
who sits alone. his eyes hurt and mild,
he waits, holding his things.
time should hold no meaning
for him yet. you don’t learn
how to play; you forget. but he knows a while
well, and longs for the clang of the bell.
a bell is a room of nothing.
no, a dome with a hidden swing —
a will, a sway, a tone, a peal,
the beginning of song. the wild
crowd nears, passes, laughing.
here is the sound of the bell.
