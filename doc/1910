dear god, our heavenly father, gracious lord,
mother love and maker, light divine,
atomic fingertip, cosmic design,
first letter of the alphabet, last word,
mutual satisfaction, cash award,
auditor who approves our bottom line,
examiner who says that we are fine,
oasis that all sands are running toward.
i can say almost anything about you,
o big idea, and with each epithet,
create new reasons to believe or doubt you,
black hole, white hole, presidential jet.
but whatâ€™s the anything i must leave out? you
solve nothing but the problems that i set.
