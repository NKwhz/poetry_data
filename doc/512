that's how it was then, a knife
through cartilage, a body broken. animal
and animal as mineral ash. a window smashed.
the collective howl as a general alarm
followed by quiet.
                                 boot-black night,
halogen hum. tape snaking through
a stealth machine. later, shattered glass
and a checkpoint charmâ€”the clasp
of a tourist-trap bracelet. an arm. a trinket.
snap goes the clamshell. the film
in the braincase preserving the sense
of the drench, the angle of the leash,
the connecting collar. a tracking long-shot.
the descent of small-town darkness.
