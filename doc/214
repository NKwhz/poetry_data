general petraeus, when the death-count of american troops
in iraq was close to 3,800, said ‘the truth is you never do get
used to losses. there is a kind of bad news vessel with holes,
 
and sometimes it drains, then it fills up, then it empties again’—
leaving, in this particular case, the residue of a long story
involving one soldier who, in the course of his street patrol,
 
tweaked the antenna on the tv in a bar hoping for baseball,
but found instead the snowy picture of men in a circle talking,
all apparently angry and perhaps jihadists. they turned out to be
 
reciting poetry. ‘my life’, said the interpreter, ‘is like a bag of flour
thrown through wind into empty thorn bushes’. then ‘no, no’, he said,
correcting himself. ‘like dust in the wind. like a hopeless man.’
