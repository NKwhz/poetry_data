dear aleph,
like ovid: i’ll have no last words.
this is what it means to die among barbarians. bar bar bar
was how the greeks heard our speech —
sheep, beasts — and so we became
barbarians. we make them reveal
the brutes they are, aleph, by the things
we make them name. david,
they tell me, is the one
one should aspire to, but ever since
i first heard them say philistine
i’ve known i am goliath
if i am anything.
