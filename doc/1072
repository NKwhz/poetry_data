we met in a coastal village
spent a lovely night without leaving an address
going separate ways. three years later
we meet again by coincidence.
the whole
three years spun a novel
we abandoned:
they fail to recognize themselves
as though meeting in another story
for an encounter.
one asks: who are you, so cold and weary
the other says: i only know a thread is loose on my sweater
            the more you pull it, the more it lengthens
            until i completely vanish.
