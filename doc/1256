and, in any event, irrelevant. the musician may not be relying on
mathematical acoustics in his calculations. he may be performing
for auditoriums; thus, his physical realities change as he travels. music
seems inevitable. every question entails some notion of what is being asked.
the motley nature is not alien. certain sounds guide the vulgar mind
to notions not anticipated by those creating the sounds. a bartender
concocts an absolut citroen gimlet, ice-cold but no ice, with one hand;
“with the other hand he gathers up gonorrhea.” most of what is imparted

thereby creating through that very act a sublime poetry.
