so the sun is shining blindingly but i can sort of see.
it’s like looking at mandela’s moral beauty.
the dying leaves are sizzling on the trees
in a shirtsleeves summer breeze.
but daylight saving is over.
and gaveling the courtroom to order with a four-leaf clover
is over. and it’s altogether november.
and the pellegrino bubbles rise to the surface and dismember.
