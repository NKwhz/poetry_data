i am a woman. no more and no less
i live my life as it is
thread by thread
and i spin my wool to wear, not
to complete homer’s story, or his sun.
and i see what i see
as it is, in its shape,
though i stare every once
in a while in its shade
to sense the pulse of defeat,
and i write tomorrow
on yesterday’s sheets: there’s no sound
other than echo.
i love the necessary vagueness in
what a night traveler says to the absence
of birds over the slopes of speech
and above the roofs of villages
i am a woman, no more and no less
the almond blossom sends me flying
in march, from my balcony,
in longing for what the faraway says:
“touch me and i’ll bring my horses to the water springs.”
i cry for no clear reason, and i love you
as you are, not as a strut
nor in vain
and from my shoulders a morning rises onto you
and falls into you, when i embrace you, a night.
but i am neither one nor the other
no, i am not a sun or a moon
i am a woman, no more and no less
so be the qyss of longing,
if you wish. as for me
i like to be loved as i am
not as a color photo
in the paper, or as an idea
composed in a poem amid the stags …
i hear laila’s faraway scream
from the bedroom: do not leave me
a prisoner of rhyme in the tribal nights
do not leave me to them as news …
i am a woman, no more and no less
i am who i am, as
you are who you are: you live in me
and i live in you, to and for you
i love the necessary clarity of our mutual puzzle
i am yours when i overflow the night
but i am not a land
or a journey
i am a woman, no more and no less
and i tire
from the moon’s feminine cycle
and my guitar falls ill
string
by string
i am a woman,
no more
and no less!
