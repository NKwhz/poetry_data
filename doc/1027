a blind man, on the thoroughfare,
startle-eyed as an owl by day,
piping a dismal little air,
taps here and there, loses his way,
 
tootles awry his time-old ditty
undauntedly, as by his side
lopes his dog, guides him through the city,
specter diurnal, sleepy-eyed.
 
days, stark, wash over him, unlit;
he hears the dark world’s constant din
and all that life unseen, as it
rolls, rushing, like a flood walled in!
 
god knows what black chimeras haunt
that brain opaque, what lot befalls;
and what dire spells the mind is wont
to scribble on those death-vault walls!
 
like prisoner grown half-mad, who, pent,
rots beneath venice in her jail
eternal, and whose hours are spent
scratching a message with a nail...
 
but when the torch, in tomb immured,
dies in the breath of death, maybe
the soul, to shades’ gloom long inured,
will see with deathly clarity!
