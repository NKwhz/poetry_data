the alcove of your arm
has become my favorite room
for sleep, but i’ve been roused
by nightmares lately. even thunderstorms
couldn’t wake you, my mother says
over the phone. i want to tell her
i’ve been seeing a white man, an american
man, but i can already imagine her:
well, you can have friends. she had never meant
for me to become a westerner —
she’s afraid of losing me to a foreigner, being unable to speak
to her future grandchildren. thousands of miles away
in korea she asks if anything is wrong. i want to laugh.
say to you, isn’t she ridiculous? but
last night a korean man broke into your room
and raped me, with you calm in your repose
next to me. he sat on my stomach with a knife,
the only gleaming thing. and you were still
in your platinum skin when i opened my eyes. how
can anything be wrong, i comfort my mother.
