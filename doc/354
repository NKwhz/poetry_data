when in the dumps, i hate the things
   that ordinarily i love.
i loathe the lark that blindly sings;
   i hate the bland, blue sky above.
the crocus, sneering on the lawn,
   forsythia about to bloomâ€”
i'd like to see them dead and gone,
   instead of filling life with gloom.
but most of all, i do not care,
   while i am droning in my hive,
to hear vivacious chums declare
   how great it is to be alive.
