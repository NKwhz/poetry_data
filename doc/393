i was reading jeffrey goldberg’s new piece
in the atlantic — it was the one about
president obama’s decision not
to be persuaded by a commonplace
that our credibility hinges on the use
of swift and massive lethal force despite
pressure even from his own cabinet
appalled that assad shelled ghouta with sarin gas —
when i thought of your poem on the way
of denial, “via negativa,” whose lines
celebrated their (your rhyme) reticence.
why am i even talking this way to you?
i watched you being buried, yet in the end
i wonder if i had ever been your friend.
