in white pleated trousers, peering through green
sunshades, looking for the way the sun is red
noise, how locusts hiss to replicate the sun.
what is the visual equivalent
of syncopation? rows of seared palms wrinkle
in the heat waves through green glass. sprinklers
tick, tick, tick. the watts towers aim to split
the sky into chroma, spires tiled with rubble
nothing less than aspiration. iâ€™ve left
minarets for sun and syncopation,
sixty-seven shades of green which i have
counted, beginning: palm leaves, front and back,
luncheon pickle, bottle glass, etcetera.
one day i will comprehend the different   
grades of red. on that day i will comprehend
these people, rhythms, jazz, simon rodia,
watts, los angeles, aspiration.
