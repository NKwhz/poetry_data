the men that worked for england
they have their graves at home:
and birds and bees of england
about the cross can roam.
 
but they that fought for england,
following a falling star,
alas, alas for england
they have their graves afar.
 
and they that rule in england,
in stately conclave met,
alas, alas for england
they have no graves as yet.
