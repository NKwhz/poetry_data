the last train pulses across the pane
and fireflies spark beside the tracks.
acne’s red wing flames my face:
i can’t take back
this skin. in the other room,
a drugstore timex synchronizes
with the faucet’s drip. if i squint,
the fireflies align their lives
to map the summer’s migraine
of flowers that were weeds.
you say, but i think
they’re just trying to survive —
cheap bulbs, they burn out in two weeks.
the train rattles as its links shift
and scrape like the dark between days.
from across the continent,
my father texts:
your mother hiked halfway up the hill
behind the cabin / a graceful
mountain goat. is this love?
lately, i’ve been writing you letters
that i shred about that blood-orange eclipse —
sleep’s determined murmurs
of eyelid and lash.
the fireflies are sunset’s ash.
i realize i have no means
by which to make you a present of the past,
where my father once cowered
behind the june sunflowers,
bloodied by the dog chain his father
had swung — not at his son,
but at the fear
of being left without one.
the fireflies stutter like an apology.
i would be lying to you
if i didn’t admit i love them.
