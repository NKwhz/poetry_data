in a courtyard, in these stacks of chairs
            before the empty stage—near are
we lord, near and graspable. lord,
            accept these humble offerings:
stacks of biscuits wrapped in cellophane,
            stacks of bone in glass: thighbone,
spine. stacks of white saucers, porcelain
            circles into which stacks of lip-worn
cups slide neat. jawbone, lord. galleries
            of laminated clippings declaring war.
hands unstack chairs into rows. the dead:
            they still go begging. what for, lord?
blunt bayonets, once sharp as wind?
            moon-pale stacks of clavicle? a hand—
            ii.
moon-pale stacks of clavicle a hand
            brushes dust from. i lost a word
that was left to me: sister. the wind
             severs through us—we sit, wait
for songs of nation and loss in neat
            long rows below this leaf-green
flag—its red-stitched circle stains
            us blood-bright blossom, stains
us river-silk—i saw you, sister, standing
            in this brilliance—i saw light sawing
through a broken car window, thistling
            us pink—i saw, sister, your bleeding
head, an unfurling shapla flower
            petaling slow across mute water—
            iii.
petaling slow
                        across mute water,
bows of trawlers
                               skimming nets
of silver fish that ripple
                                        through open
hands that will carve them
                                                  skin-
less. we were hands,
                                      we scooped
the darkness empty. we
                                              are rooted
bodies in rows silent before
                                                    the sparked
blue limbs of dancers
                                       leafing the dark
light indigo, then
                               jasmine alighting
into a cup, then
                             hands overturning
postcards bearing flag
                                         and flower, hands
cradling the replica of a boat,
                                                     hands
thrust there and into
                                             nothingness. you,
a corpse, sister, bathed
                                          jasmine, blue—
            iv.
a corpse: sister, bathed jasmine. blue,
                                       the light leading me from this gift shop into
a gallery of gray stones: heartgray puddles,
                          two mouthfuls of silence: the shadow
            cast by the portrait of a raped woman trapped
in a frame, face hidden behind her own black
                            river of hair: photo that a solemn girl
your corpse's age stands still and small
                         before. she asks, did someone hurt her?
               did she do something bad? her mother
                                           does not reply. her father turns, shudders,
as the light drinks our silences, parched—
                             as i too turn in light, spine-scraped—
you teach you teach your hands to sleep

you teach you teach your hands to sleep
because her hands can't hold the shape
of a shapla flower cut from its green leaf
because her hands can't hold grief
nor light nor sister     in her hands fistfuls
of her own hair    on her wrists glass bangles
like the one you struggled over your hand
the same hand that slapped a sister's wan
face    look   the young girl stands before
the photo of the young woman who swore
she would not become the old woman
crouched low on a jute mat holding
out to you a bangle    a strange lostness was
bodily present       you came near to living
            vi.
bodily present, you came near to living,
            poet, in this small blue dress still stained,
the placard states, with the blood of the child
            crushed dead by a soldier's boot. who failed
and fails?—nights you couldn't bear the threshed
            sounds of your heart's hard beating. i press
a button: 1971 springs forth: black and white
            bodies marching in pixelated rows. nights
you resuscitated the word, sea-overflowed,
            star-overflown. a pixelated woman tied
with a white rope to a black pole, her white
            sari embroidered with mud or blood. nights
you were the wax to seal what's unwritten—
            the screen goes white in downdrifting light.
            vii.
the screen goes white. in downdrifting light,
            the stairwell is a charred tunnel. we walk out
of it into the couttyard—my skirt flares a rent
            into the burnt evening. something was silent,
something went its way—something gnashes
            inside me, sister—along the yellow gashes
of paint guiding me through these rooms lined
            with glass cases, past machine gun chains
shaped into the word bangla. here, on this
            stage, a dancer bows low her limbs
once more before us. the stage goes silent.
            we gather ourselves: souvenirs of bone.
pray, lord. we are near. near are we, lord—
            in a courtyard, in these stacks of chairs.
