of making many books there is no end,
   though myriads have to deep oblivion gone;
each day new manuscripts are being penned,
   and still the ceaseless tide of ink flows on.
though myriads have to deep oblivion gone,
   new volumes daily issue from the press;
and still the ceaseless tide of ink flows on—
   the prospect is disheartening, i confess.
new volumes daily issue from the press;
   my pile of unread books i view aghast.
the prospect is disheartening, i confess;
   why will these modern authors write so fast?
my pile of unread books i view aghast—
   of course i must keep fairly up to date—
why will these modern authors write so fast?
   they seem to get ahead of me of late.
of course i must keep fairly up to date;
   the books of special merit i must read;
they seem to get ahead of me of late,
   although i skim them very fast indeed.
the books of special merit i must read;
   and then the magazines come round again;
although i skim them very fast indeed,
   i can’t get through with more than eight or ten.
and then the magazines come round again!
   how can we stem this tide of printer’s ink?
i can’t get through with more than eight or ten—
   it is appalling when i stop to think.
how can we stem this tide of printer’s ink?
   of making many books there is no end.
it is appalling when i stop to think
   each day new manuscripts are being penned!
