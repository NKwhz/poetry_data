i’m not interested in sadness,
just a yard as elder earth,
a library of sunflowers
battered by the night’s rain.
when sliced wide, halved at dawn,
i can see how you exist,
o satellite town, your bright possibility
born again in drywall
and the diary with the trick lock.
hardly held, for years i slept
with my window wide open,
wanting screen-cut threads of rain.
blind suburb, dear untruth,
you who already know what i mean
when i praise every spared copse,
you were my battery, my sad clue,
but after i mowed the lawn
and watched robins chesting
for seeds i couldn’t resist
what hung in the toolshed,
where, with a pair of garden shears
i cut all the hair from my arms. that need,
that scared need to whiten
or clean a surface: plywood or lawn,
and the spywall behind which i stood,
stock-still, and sinned against
the fly’s flyness. though you live
inside me, though you laid eggs
in the moisture at the corners
of my eyes, i still dream about
your sinking empire twenty feet above
sea level, and the many things
you never see: beautiful bleached
gas can, tomato posts bent into art,
how half of a butterfly, cut crosswise,
still looks like a butterfly, etc.
