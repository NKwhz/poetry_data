a birdless heaven, sea-dusk and a star
sad in the west;
and thou, poor heart, loveâ€™s image, fond and far,
rememberest:
her silent eyes and her soft foam-white brow
and fragrant hair,
falling as in the silence falleth now
dusk from the air.
ah, why wilt thou remember these, or why,
poor heart, repine,
if the sweet love she yielded with a sigh
was never thine?
