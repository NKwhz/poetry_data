                                                      14
                                              in the wake
 
riding north on the bus after hours in cars
or in the air or airports or bus stations,
 
i felt almost happy for a moment
as the tires hissed over the wet highway,
 
i was both in the rain and protected
from it, distracted from grief
 
by the sensual pressure of the instant,
water beading on the glass, the darkening hills.
 
but how glad i was to be riding north!
sunoco on one side, mobil on the other.
 
his best friend was from mobile.
i always wanted to go there.
 
he died too soon, or i left home,
i can’t remember.
 
two days ago my stepfather’s body
was laid to rest.
 
comatose, sucking air
through a respirator, i can’t say
 
he was resting; i saw him
underground when i closed
 
my eyes at night and went
to bury the clock under mounds
 
of towels and pillows—i had not
heard it ticking so ferociously
 
while he lived—and it would not
quiet down. and the rain
 
tonight, it’s not like any other,
and i wish the bus would go faster.
 
i saw the rain in the heavy hanging clouds.
that’s a lie. immense factories
 
blackening under a charcoal sky—
and rivers whose names i’ll never remember.
 
i saw a sign reflected in my window:
milwaukee light.
 
                                                              *
 
whenever the chicago white sox
beat the braves it made his day.
 
the braves were in milwaukee then,
with lefty warren spahn and slugger hank aaron.
 
the bus company is peter pan,
and the peter pan coffee shop
 
 was our first stop in chicago when we drove in;
and that’s where i was when,
 
though i didn’t know it then,
he married my mother in bermuda—
 
watching peter pan in new york
with my “real” father…
 
and oh those prophetic lines,
not to grow up, never to go to school.
never then to die! only the living
are immortal. like these rain clouds.
 
                                                               *
 
the fact of death—a silence attends it;
an absence with which we’re all
 
 
he was the lightest sleeper i’d ever known;
he’d open one eye if i merely peeked into his room.
intimate. he’s there when i close
my eyes but not when i reach out in the dark.
 
at his bedside i peeled back his eyelids,
rubbed his blue feet, his bloated hands,
 
almost screamed in his ear,
wake up, man, i’ll be lonely without you,
 
i’ll be angry if you don’t wake up;
and in the silence of our nearness to death—
 
the grinding hum of the generators
working at their limit for too long
 
to pump cool air in the killing heat;
the glug of him swallowing through the respirator.
 
                                                                *
 
    at the bus station in springfield, massachusetts
 
the lateness of the bus angers
a tough young woman from montana
 
travelling with her toddler son.
and yet she knows the way: i can see it
 
in her green peaked cap,
her direct taut anger—bus late,
 
i kill the driver—boy knock over
suitcase—i kill him too.
 
                                                                 *
 
                                              bus boarded
 
the water bubbles on the windows
break; there is less and less outside to see…
 
and he was not even my real father.
that should put a cap on it.
 
it’s like knowing the name of the lake
you pass never seeing it again and yet
 
finding it tough to forget,
that jagged square of black water
 
just off the highway—
that lake, and not another.
 
                                                                *
 
baudelaire boasted that he laughed
at funerals and wept at feasts.
 
now in the bus it’s only early evening;
i turn around and everyone’s sleeping—
 
mother and son, matron and magician.
half-awake, i stare at the tree line,
 
and the blessing of rain,
and i would like to lie down on the roadside
 
and drink and drink and roll
in the mud.
 
                                                                *
 
mortifying, one’s presence in the face
of nature’s sanguine gaze,
 
green whitewashing
the past. whatever grooms
 
the body for the afterlife
pitches in this life like a tent
 
in a night encampment before
the dawn storming of the fortress.
 
the yellow day lilies wag
their heads at the first
 
touch of wind and i see what
others have always seen
 
in flowers, a sign marked
transients
 
that keeps them awake; see
now, as, standing catatonic
 
at the kitchen sink, the overhead
fluorescent light strip sinks into the pitch
 
dark bottom of a coffee mug.
seeing is native to us and yet
 
we stupefy our native sight.
not the eye’s sight.
 
                                                                *
 
some mourners hurl dirt stiffly on the coffin
because it seems the right thing to do.
 
some hold back. the flag-draped casket honors
the first army chaplain in the pacific theater,
 
for praying good prayers above the bodies
of the dead and of the living.
 
 
                                   prelude to an afterword
 
why should i feel compelled to write
          a thousand postscripts when i don’t
work from life, but to hear
          the testimonials of people
 
who knew the rider, the “little rabbi,”
          moves me to tears while i am here
to attend my mother who lies
          in bed with her stomach reaching
 
toward the sky—(where sam talks
          calmly to his “grandpa in heaven,”
matter-of-fact celestial discourse)—
          and i listen to this baptist preacher
 
and hospice worker as he crouches beside my chair
          in her hospital room talk about his work
with mourning; how difficult
          it is to get people to understand
 
the element of surprise-over-time…;
          how he kissed the little rabbi
the first time he met him
          and the last time he saw him
 
before “death took him so swiftly”
          there were no “last words”
and he was enveloped in silence,
          in absence—“the way death often
 
comes...” i see him more clearly
          through this stranger’s eyes.
i wouldn’t have thought that he could help
          confirm my sense of what is real,
 
but this man who knew him less than two years
          feels so indebted that i allow myself
to think of the rider’s life in terms of the people
          he affected, the bizarre love he could
 
elicit—not standard preacherly fare
          by any means but some connection
by being entirely present for others—
          promiscuously present—
 
meanwhile, as the nurses haul my mother
          from wheelchair to bed
why do i feel impelled to turn
          away… (we think we have the answers) …
 
and flash to an image of my friend caring
          for her father—bathing him?—but she
didn’t come out of his penis, did she?
          or is that another wrong turning in my thought?
 
the hospice preacher offers a prayer.
          he holds my mother’s swollen, psoriatic hand,
the arthritic clumps poling from her fingers,
          and as the dry, flaky patches blaze
 
in the unforgiving light, i find
          not a word to object to—except two—
“religion” and “churches.” i tell him that i left home
          as soon as i could because i couldn’t stand
 
being around the two of them; he admits he always
          felt sick “for hours afterward”
when he’d been with them together;
          it wasn’t just quarreling, i have to add,
 
seeking absolution for my absence,
          but hatred (can’t let my mother milk
the bereaved widow role). he nods—
          matter-of-factly. and sets me free.
