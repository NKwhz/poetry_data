can you imagine waking up
every morning on a different planet,
each with its own gravity?
slogging, wobbling,
wavering. atilt
and out-of-sync
with all that moves
and doesn’t.
through years of trial
and mostly error
did i study this unsteady way —
changing pills, adjusting the dosage,
never settling.
a long time we were separate,
o earth,
but now you have returned to me.
