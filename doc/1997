has its little hobbies. the lung
likes its air best after supper,
goes deeper there to trade up
for oxygen, give everything else
away. (and before supper, yes,
during too, but there’s
something about evening, that
slow breath of the day noticed: oh good,
still coming, still going ... ) as for
bones—femur, spine,
the tribe of them in there—they harden
with use. the body would like
a small mile or two. thank you.
it would like it on a bike
or a run. or in the water. blue.
and food. a habit that involves
a larger circumference where a garden’s
involved, beer is brewed, cows
wake the farmer with their fullness,
a field surrenders its wheat, and wheat
understands i will be crushed
into flour and starry-dust
the whole room, the baker
sweating, opening a window
to acknowledge such remarkable
confetti. and the brain,
locked in its strange
dual citizenship, idles there in the body,
neatly terraced and landscaped.
or left to ruin, such a brain,
wild roses growing
next to the sea. the body is
gracious about that. oh, their
scent sometimes. their
tangle. in truth, in secret,
the first thing
in morning the eye longs to see.
