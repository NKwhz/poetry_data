the idiot goes round and around
with his brother in a bumping car
at the fair. the famous idiot
smile hangs over the carâ€™s edge,
illuminating nothing. this is mankind
being taken for a ride by a rich
relation. the responses are fixed:
bump, smile; bump, smile. and the current
is generated by the smooth flow
of the shillings. this is an orchestra
of steel with the constant percussion
of laughter. but where he should be laughing
too, his features are split open, and look!
out of the cracks come warm, human tears.
