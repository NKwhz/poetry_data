if you subtract the minor losses,
you can return to your childhood too:
the blackboard chalked with crosses,
 
the math teacher’s toe ring. you
can be the black boy not even the buck-
toothed girls took a liking to:
 
this match box, these bones in their funk
machine, this thumb worn smooth
as the belly of a shovel. thump. thump.
 
thump. everything i hold takes root.
i remember what the world was like before
i heard the tide humping the shore smooth,
 
and the lyrics asking: how long has your door
been closed? i remember a garter belt wrung
like a snake around a thigh in the shadows
 
of a wedding gown before it was flung
out into the bluest part of the night.
suppose you were nothing but a song
 
in a busted speaker? suppose you had to wipe
sweat from the brow of a righteous woman,
but all you owned was a dirty rag? that’s why
 
the blues will never go out of fashion:
their half rotten aroma, their bloodshot octaves of
consequence; that’s why when they call, boy, you’re in
