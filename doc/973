a ball cap that says
               in dog years i’m dead—“the moon
will turn blood red and then
               disappear for awhile,” the tv enthused. hunched
over an anatomy textbook, a student
               traces a heart
               over another heart—lunar eclipse.

               to care about this. we really need you
to peer through the clinic’s
               storefront window, on alert

the knocked-out flesh. each of our heads
               fitting like a flash drive
               into the port of a healer’s hands.
