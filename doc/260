the night max wore his wolf suit
made him infamous, bred the child star
never sent to bed. middle school,
max started drinking. not in my house,
his mother begged, no, no, no, wild thing.
max reminded her who bought
this condo, who paid for her meds.
freshman year, max raved. roared
his terrible roar, rolled, and almost
wound up in a warehouse dead.
where, oh where, do the wild things
go? to rehab in high school.
to college on residual book sales.
max kept his head down. laughed
at drunken frat boys. bro, let the wild
rumpus start. max said, no thanks,
and volunteered for the peace corps
instead. two years in kenya, one
in belarus, the president thought
max might be of some use. max
moved to washington, appointed
at the state department a cultural
attach√©. one important day max wore
his wolf-gray suit, then drove home
well past rush hour in a freak snow storm.
max drove on the deserted beltway,
thought it his throne. yes, max belted,
this is where the wild things roam.
