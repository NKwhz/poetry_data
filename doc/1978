don't bring haw into the house at night
or in any month with a red fruit in season
or when starlings bank against the light,
don't bring haw in. don't give me reason
to think you have hidden haw about you.
tucked in secret, may its thorn thwart you.
plucked in blossom, powdered by your thumb,
i will smell it for the hum of haw is long,
its hold is low and lilting. if you bring
haw in, i will know you want me gone
to the fairies and their jilting. i will know
you want me buried in the deep green field   
where god knows what is rotting.
