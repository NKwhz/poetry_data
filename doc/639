the first to arrive when the sleepy-eyed coach
   grunts good morning and undoes the rusty lock,
       he starts each day facing the water alone—
the shimmering skin over the cold deep end
    holding the calm of sunrise before his mind
       bellows start. he plunges in to tame the water
before the water tames him back—cutting meat
   and treading at the y each weekend only keeping
       the pounds in place. on the deck stool with
his fake leg stretched before him, the coach rasps
   his creeds from the navy. there’s standing tough
       and moving tough, he tells them. whichever one’s
tougher, that’s what you do. on the cold mornings,
    the slowest tries standing tough, his feet buckled
        in at the water’s edge and every still joint its own
heady fix. when he moves, he moves to reach
   the finish line. the team is mired in last, not quailing
       from the season’s end the only victory left. all around,
hungry, he eyes the greater meets: the varsity team
   that shreds the water twice as fast, the seniors’ cars
       and flaunted car keys. is every test decided
by the one before? do the mind, the joints ever forget?
    he stares down the water, his body cold and primed
       for the tournament, finals, anything assigned.
