sit on the park bench and chew this mint leaf.
right now, way above your head, two men
floating in a rocket ship are ignoring their
delicate experiments, their buttons flashing
red. watching you chew your mint, the men
forget about their gritty toothpaste, about
their fingers, numb from lack of gravity.
they see you and, for the first time since
liftoff, think home. when they were boys
they were gentle. and smart. one could
tie string around a fly without cinching it
in half. one wrote tales of sailors who
drowned after mistaking the backs of
whales for islands. does it matter which
man is which? they just quit their mission
for you. they’re on their way down. you’ll
take both men — a winter husband and
a summer husband. does it matter which
is — don’t slump like that. get up, we have
so much work to do before —                          wait               you’re going
the wrong     way               small whelp of a woman!         this is not
              how we     behave                       where are you going
                                                                                              this world is already       willing
to give you anything                  do you want to know latin
                                                                                                         okay             now everyone
here knows latin            want inflatable     deer               deer !               i promise the winter /
summer children will barely hurt                   dear        i’m hurt   that you would ever think
                                         i don’t glisten to you         i’m always glistening
   tame your voice       and               turn around
the men are coming                    they’ve traded everything for you               the gemmy   starlight
              the click                          click                                  click
                                                                                                              of the universe   expanding
                                                                                                  stop
                   aren’t you known              aren’t you
                                                                              known here
how can you be certain that anywhere else will provide
                                                                                    more pears than you could ever eat
                           remember the sweet rot of it all
come back             you forgot your sweater
                                        what if there’s nothing there when you —
                                                                         you don’t have your
