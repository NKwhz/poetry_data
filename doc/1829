why is my verse so barren of new pride,
so far from variation or quick change?
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
why write i still all one, ever the same,
and keep invention in a noted weed,
that every word doth almost tell my name,
showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
o know, sweet love, i always write of you,
and you and love are still my argument,
so all my best is dressing old words new,
spending again what is already spent:
   for as the sun is daily new and old,
   so is my love still telling what is told.
