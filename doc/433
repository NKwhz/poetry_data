in the half-light, i am most
at home, my shadow
as company.
 
when i feel hot, i push a button
to make it stop. i mean this stain on my mind
i can’t get out. how human
 
i seem. like modern man,
i traffic in extinction. i have a gift.
like an animal, i sustain.
 
a flock of birds
when touched, i scatter. i won’t approach
until the back is turned.
 
my heart betrays. i confess: i am afraid.
how selfish of me.
when there’s no one here, i halve
 
the distance between
our bodies infinitesimally.
in this long passageway, i pose
 
against the wallpaper, dig
my heels in, catch the light.
in my vision, the back door opens
 
on a garden that is always
in bloom. the dogs
are chained so they can’t attack like i know
 
they want to. in the next yard
over, honeybees swarm
and their sound is huge.
