you elbow me with your corduroy jacket
when a box chock-full of antique marbles comes up.
i can’t hear your whispers above the auctioneer’s racket.
 
the clipped speech of the auctioneer cracked
me up when you impersonated him in bed. like a wild, thick mop
i soak up every copper smell from your corduroy jacket.
 
in two days, i will drive you to the airport, packed
with other couples pressed tightly at the top
of the escalator. lines sear my cheek from your corduroy jacket
 
when we hug—then a quick kiss good-bye tacked
on at the end. i’ll finger the rim on the paper coffee cup
you leave in my car. when i hear your name i can’t forget
 
how your long torso pressed against my bare back,
bluish in this early light. your fingers shot into me, popped
my spine into a wicked arch. there is no lack
 
of how it haunts me still—what i bid—lost, sacked
and wrapped for other girls. i should have looked up
to see who else was bidding, but i studied the folds in your jacket.
my limit is spent, loud and certain as the auctioneer’s racket.
