o ancient one,
your web hangs down from the pines.
i am of the owl clan.
i have been to water,
my dress is of red clay.
he moves at the edge of you,
binds us with your threads.
the center of his soul shall be my soulâ€™s center.
our paths shall be white forever.
where we move the paths from every direction
shall recognize each other.
we are one never to be parted.
