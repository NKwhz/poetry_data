yea, gold is son of zeus: no rust
    its timeless light can stain;
the worm that brings man's flesh to dust
    assaults its strength in vain:
more gold than gold the love i sing,
a hard, inviolable thing.
men say the passions should grow old
     with waning years; my heart
is incorruptible as gold,
     'tis my immortal part:
nor is there any god can lay
on love the finger of decay.
