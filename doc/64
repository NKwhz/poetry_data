my body a full echo                i dawdle down to the creek
                          ask the god of blood for
                          abundance     continuity
                                      my offering      the syrup of pressed beans   &
                                      a 7-winged tulip

later the rains swell the creek with coffee            the storm        a beckoned sheet
the immortal herself reaping the earth          the tongues cut out of the cows
  iii.
i walk in                       as the wash      attempts its valiant swallow
             a cafeteria aid             wipes the cotton from the counter
             her bald eyes              aurora with       seeds
                         you brought that           didn’t you?

                                                               my bottom lip a pink venom     my desire a valley with
                                                               legs       his steady fingers toying the tea            i look
                                                               up to a straight line and bury it    can’t downsize what
                                                               hithers me
                                                               every now & then a troubled thirst
                                                               opens my mouth for a song that does not come
                                                                            i feel it all
                                                                      until a fixed voice decides
                                                                                        no      but wait      you’re the water
