my transgressions pile against the garden wall
(built when rome began to weaken, scarred
by a cannonball.) i gossiped; i snubbed
a dinner guest. i watch until the wall writhes
with awful feral cats fed by shrunken widows
and the odd librarian. i’ve begun to be depleted
by your absence; one of  love’s worst symptoms.
for years, i’d had the sense to hold myself apart.
i’ve been here long enough to kill
two mint plants and a lavender,
then resurrect their better part.
i’d like to let you die on the vine.
not you, the you i dream,
who follows through on waking.
see how the watcher sees the storm
but doesn’t get wet. be that.
be what?
be wiser than the heart.
