it smiles to see me
still in my bathrobe.
it sits in my lap
and will not let me rise.
now it is kissing my eyes.
arms enfold me, arms
pale with a thick down.
it seems i am falling asleep
to the sound of a story
being read me.
this is the story.
weeks have passed
since first i lifted my hand
to set it down.
