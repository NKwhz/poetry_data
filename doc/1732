even in fortunate times,
the nectar is spiked with woe.
gods are incorrigibly
capricious, and the needy
beg in nineveh or sleep
in paper-gusting plazas
of the new world’s shopping malls.
meantime, the tyrant battens
on conquest, while advisers,
angling for preferment, seek
expedient paths. heartbroken,
the faithful advocate looks
back on cities of the plain
and trudges into exile.
and if any era thrives,
it’s only because, somewhere,
in a plane tree’s shade, friends sketch
the dust with theorems and proofs,
or because, instinctively,
a man puts his arm around
the shoulder of grief and walks
it (for an hour or an age)
through all its tears and telling.
