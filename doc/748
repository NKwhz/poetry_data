three lovely notes he whistled, too soft to be heard
if others sang; but others never sang
in the great beech-wood all that may and june.
no one saw him: i alone could hear him
though many listened. was it but four years
ago? or five? he never came again.
 
oftenest when i heard him i was alone,
nor could i ever make another hear.
la-la-la! he called, seeming far-off—
as if a cock crowed past the edge of the world,
as if the bird or i were in a dream.
yet that he travelled through the trees and sometimes
neared me, was plain, though somehow distant still
he sounded. all the proof is—i told men
what i had heard.
 
                                   i never knew a voice,
man, beast, or bird, better than this. i told
the naturalists; but neither had they heard
anything like the notes that did so haunt me,
i had them clear by heart and have them still.
four years, or five, have made no difference. then
as now that la-la-la! was bodiless sweet:
sad more than joyful it was, if i must say
that it was one or other, but if sad
'twas sad only with joy too, too far off
for me to taste it. but i cannot tell
if truly never anything but fair
the days were when he sang, as now they seem.
this surely i know, that i who listened then,
happy sometimes, sometimes suffering
a heavy body and a heavy heart,
now straightway, if i think of it, become
light as that bird wandering beyond my shore.
