i have come again to the perfumed city.
houses with tiered porches, some decorated with shells.
you know from the windows that the houses
are from a different time. i am not
to blame for what changes, though sometimes
i have trouble sleeping.
between the carriage houses,
there are little gardens separated by gates.
lately, i have been thinking about the gates.
the one ornamented with the brass lion, i remember
it was warm to the touch
even in what passes here for winter.
but last night, when i closed my eyes,
it was not the lion that i pictured first.
