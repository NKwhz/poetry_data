oysters adhere
to things, no eyes:
spat on the smooth
curve of a pier
they feel shadows   
and snap shut.
the sun wavers
while anchored below
each distills
tomales bay,
accreting waves
within its shell.
voluptuous and cold,
kumamoto trembles
on a thin fork,
liquefaction
of cloud. rain
distorts glass,
our tavern submerged
all afternoon.
