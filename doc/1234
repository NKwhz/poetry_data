i am standing outside
in minnesota
ghost wind recalling
names in winter mist
the road smells
of dogs two days dead
white photographers talk in
the house of mainstream
media
i can’t articulate
the agony of eagle singer’s
children to them.
we celebrate the old
man while another
generation shoots
crushed and heated
prescriptions
sells baskets,
machinery,
the fixtures yet to be
installed in the house,
yet to be heated
by the tribal government,
for another night
stolen by the stupors
and the wondrous
pleasure of forget
everything medicines.
back inside
uncle two dogs rolls me
a smoke out of
organic american spirit
i look to a last cup
of coffee.
the way home
fills with snow
our tracks
human and machine.
