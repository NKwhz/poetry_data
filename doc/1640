the human cylinders
revolving in the enervating dusk
that wraps each closer in the mystery
of singularity
among the litter of a sunless afternoon
having eaten without tasting
talked without communion
and at least two of us
loved a very little
without seeking
to know if our two miseries
in the lucid rush-together of automatons
could form one opulent wellbeing
simplifications of men
in the enervating dusk
your indistinctness
serves me the core of the kernel of you
when in the frenzied reaching out of intellect to intellect
leaning brow to brow       communicative
over the abyss of the potential
concordance of respiration
shames
absence of corresponding between the verbal sensory
and reciprocity
of conception
and expression
where each extrudes beyond the tangible
one thin pale trail of speculation
from among us we have sent out
into the enervating dusk
one little whining beast
whose longing
is to slink back to antediluvian burrow
and one elastic tentacle of intuition
to quiver among the stars
the impartiality of the absolute
routs      the polemic
or which of us
would not
receiving the holy-ghost
catch it      and caging
lose it
or in the problematic
destroy the universe
with a solution
