there is someone who knows.
in no beginning
         was there just one language
nor did the surface gleam
with nineteen hours
of music as in our body-heat
through the head & limbs
the thumb and index finger
to form the ovular oh
of our self-fathering fable
war flail â‰ˆ morning star
the original garden erudite,
lush lawn, & round
of trees
behind the limestone square, night
rain out of paper, under
the lights of the narrow
path up the rose hill.
from a dark corner rising now
to write orange with a knife
over green of the elusive
wall no one is watching
