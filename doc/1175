with thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain.
pretending to run for cover but secretly praying for more rain.
over the echo of the water, i hear a voice saying my name.
no one in the city moves under the quick sightless rain.
the pages of my notebook soak, then curl. i’ve written:
“yogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain.”
the sky is a bowl of dark water, rinsing your face.
the window trembles; liquid glass could shatter into rain.
i am a dark bowl, waiting to be filled.
if i open my mouth now, i could drown in the rain.
i hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me.
the night collapses into your skin. i am the rain.
