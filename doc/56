because it changes o’hare to o hate,
o hate, o hate — over and over, no matter
how many times i retype it. o hate, like
an american tune, an american fable
where, yo, you can enter an o hate
bathroom, take a selfie in the mirror
cuz your sister wants to see the pockets
of your great american rhinestone jeans.
because, on a street called viewpoint,
i get home becomes i get guns, off a road
on a mission to kill every squirrel-ish
pedestrian. because he was packing,
concealed, threatening to use it, use
his hands or feet. my feet, iamb
of a son of a birch, of a brick chatting
with the devil, with god, with a listener
not listening. because he’d gone bonnets,
his garden bounty a faded wine, his wife’s
linguine a longing for a golden ear,
so i took her to the botanical gardens
in my getaway car, to a fruit on a vine,
but the limes went lemur, the night to nonfat,
the clear to catastrophic. because driving away
from the frog man croaking hypocrite,
heavenly went down like a melting hedge,
a gal gone hog-tied, a fish crying, a tiger-
tiger togetherness, flight or fucked,
a heart, stroked, racing to its vicarious
carousel, a fungus lashed to a beam gone
beleaguered. because he will kill her,
that’s his plan: to kill us all. can’t commit
or commute, can’t debone his breath,
can’t take his acute paranoia, chalk it up
to cute. because this here’s a josie
madhouse, a bedroom bedrock-locked.
because blvd morphed to bled, spirit
summoned with a ouija board. because
soap holder went love hen, though love
had flown the calycanthus
like the grilled portobellos messing
with his vowels. please please, i pleaded
to the pleading day. because prayer
is like a bread line, a penny for your
exploded mind. because lots of logs
to you, ma, because so sorry went poem.
