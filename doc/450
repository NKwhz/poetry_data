this is a poured-truth dressed in memory
and cut down; this is a matter ruff; a gray middle
the world is in flight and many things circle.
 
what world do you want me in? i ask.
but i am confronted with touch, the work of hand and eye,
and a kept-remark roaming ...
when in rome, i think.
+
a dressed-memory: never did more frill mean curtained-silence.
  hello?
weâ€™re here, they say.
i remember the moment first-harvested: no possible brimming is
ever frank. at that age, who knew filth could be forward. i thought
i could cut it down.

look, the leaping is possible, i think. i watch the way evening attaches
to us. see its starting point? it banded, uncontrolled and gleaming.
our jewel. not all worlds see the darkness.
remember: the world is good, that leaping center is a tuned heart.
i want that melody.
+
what world do you want me in, now? i ask
i feel broad-throated, and slippy.
i say, tell me the times the chronicle mentions me.
  56, she says.
let me be clear: i knew. i said, i knew. i wanted to have my own grown romance.
plant me another. do it now.
