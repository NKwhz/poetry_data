when with the skin you do acknowledge drought,
the dry in the voice, the lightness of feet, the fine
flake of the heat at every level line;
when with the hand you learn to touch without
surprise the spine for the leaf, the prickled petal,
the stone scorched in the shine, and the wood brittle;
then where the pipe drips and the fronds sprout
and the foot-square forest of clover blooms in sand,
you will lean and watch, but never touch with your hand.
