off-season and in
the burnt forest
of my nightgown, a feral
undergrowth that marks
me as burial site—
to be still enough or
just enough.
my arms become fat arms:
hearth. i eat dirt for doubt,
a secret bleached
old as lie. i out-want
like a spindly
winged monster.
if i were a bug—
were i—then you'd hope
for reparation, and paint
more brown into the plot.
