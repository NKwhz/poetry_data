   of water. it was
this or that way
                              with
         the dead and we
       were them. no

       millet beer made
 our legs go weak,

  our tongues. “the dead,”
                                                we
       said, “are drowning
    of thirst,” gruff
     summons we muttered
  out loud in our
                               sleep...

up like a rug, raw sprawl
                                              of a
       book within a book
     without a name known as
        namless, not to be
arrived at again...
                                   it was
   the book of no avail we
were in did we dare name
  it, momentary kings and

   run weft at last
 adequate, shadowless,
