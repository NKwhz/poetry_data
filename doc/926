as so-called quarks, so atoms before and through
and after molecules, which too
constitute us awhile, pluming

through our slowly changing shapes
like beachscapes
through a duneless sandglass, say

(i said, once) — all these
so utterly forgetful, wiped clean
as numbers with each new use, lint-free.

how not so words, which pass our minds
and mouths and ears from hind-
most elsewhere, on their way to elsewhere — why

so?
words are the sum of their histories: rose
and roke and no and blanketing snow.

so much less lego-like, click-
click together than like slick
tentacular

colonial hydrozoans tossed
together in the copper pots
of   predication — all cross-

shock and shimmery tangle —
how can
anyone calculate semantic

sets so dervishly complex?
how can we not expect not less but hellish
much more than to mean what we say? then guess:

how can we better but
hope to become in sum what
we say when we say again love?
