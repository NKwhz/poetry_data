you are beadwork woven by a broken indian woman
that i mend with cautious, needle-pricked fingers.
you are raw sweetness of burning chaga
scraping my lungs and startling tears.
you are the bear claw necklace
no longer caressing
the space between my breasts.
you are cigarettes
that i quit years ago,
but sometimes smoke anyways.
you are maple syrup on snow
melting on my tongue
until i ache from the cold.
you are the cedar tree
sheltering my childhood
from unwanted caresses.
you are the star blanket
sliding off the bed on autumnal nights.
you are a stubborn braid of wiingashk
that must be relit with a dozen matches
before it releases thin streamers of sweetness.
you are the love song
played on a reedless flute
that only spirits hear.
