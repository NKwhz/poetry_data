these brown piles
of stubble
hills
have failed.
they should be more
                       •
it should be difficult
but not impossible
to transmute
latitude
into a thought
a god could
hold.
                       •
barred light:
dunes coming on
and on.
                       •
the eye, yes,
must move
to prevent
blank spots
from making themselves
known.
