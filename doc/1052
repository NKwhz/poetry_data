i was born in minutes in a roadside kitchen a skillet
whispering my name. i was born to rainwater and lye;
i was born across the river where i
was borrowed with clothespins, a harrow tooth,
broadsides sewn in my shoes. i returned, though
it please you, through no fault of my own,
pockets filled with coffee grounds and eggshells.
i was born still and superstitious; i bore an unexpected burden.
i gave birth, i gave blessing, i gave rise to suspicion.
i was born abandoned outdoors in the heat-shaped air,
air drifting like spirits and old windows.
i was born a fraction and a cipher and a ledger entry;
i was an index of first lines when i was born.
i was born waist-deep stubborn in the water crying
                              ainâ€™t i a woman and a brother i was born
to this hall of mirrors, this horror story i was
born with a prologue of references, pursued
by mosquitoes and thieves, i was born passing
off the problem of the twentieth century: i was born.
i read minds before i could read fishes and loaves;
i walked a piece of the way alone before i was born.
