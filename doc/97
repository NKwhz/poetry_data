here’s what i had in mind, kōtiro, this
clipping at words like overgrown maikuku —
return the blankets of domestic life; don’t fold
washing or wear shoes, polish these rerenga kē.
eh. but this world.
i s’pose neither of us planned to be in politics,
never did do what others told us to —
wahanui though, go on, get
your sedition on girl,
your agitator, your defiant speak
to each other eye to eye —
māori been jailed for nouns, phrases;
butcher up a clause, get buried
in pākehā kupu, then dig that
out like the old people. no one approved
of their language either.
