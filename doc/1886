incautious youth, why do'st thou so mis-place
thy fine encomiums on an o’er-blown face;
which after all the varnish of thy quill,
its pristine wrinkles shew apparent still:
nor is it in the power of youth to move
an age-chill’d heart to any strokes of love.
then chuse some budding beauty, which in time
may crown thy wishes in thy blooming prime:
for nought can make a more preposterous show,
than april’s flowers stuck on st. michael’s bow.
to consecrate thy first-born sighs to me,
a superannuated deity;
makes that idolatry and deadly sin,
which otherwise had only venial been.
