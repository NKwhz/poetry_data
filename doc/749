she was a city of patience; of proud name,
dimmed by neglecting time; of beauty and loss;
of acquiescence in the creeping moss.
but on a sudden fierce destruction came
tigerishly pouncing: thunderbolt and flame
showered on her streets, to shatter them and toss
her ancient towers to ashes. riven across,
she rose, dead, into never-dying fame.
white against heavens of storm, a ghost, she is known
to the world's ends. the myriads of the brave
sleep round her. desolately glorified,
she, moon-like, draws her own far-moving tide
of sorrow and memory; toward her, each alone,
glide the dark dreams that seek an english grave.
