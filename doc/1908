i sowed the seeds of love
to blossom all the spring,
in april, may, or else in june,
when the small birds do sing:
a gardener standing by,
i desired him to choose for me;
he picked out the lily, the violet, and pink,
but i refused all three.
the lily i refused,
because it faded so soon;
the violet and pink i overlooked,
resolved was to tarry till june:
in june the red roses bud,
oh, that is a lover for me;
but i have often aimed at the red rose-bud,
and i have gained the willow tree.
the gardener standing by,
he prayed me to have a care,
for the thorn that grew on the red rose-bush,
a venomous thorn they were:
a venomous thorn indeed,
for still i feel the smart;
and every time i did it touch,
it pricked my tender heart.
away you fading flowers,
no more i will you touch,
that all the world may plainly see
i loved one flower too much.
