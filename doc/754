as i went up by ovillers
   in mud and water cold to the knee,
there went three jeering, fleering spectres,
   that walked abreast and talked of me.
 
the first said, ‘here’s a right brave soldier
   that walks the dark unfearingly;
soon he’ll come back on a fine stretcher,
   and laughing for a nice blighty.’
 
the second, ‘read his face, old comrade,
   no kind of lucky chance i see;
one day he’ll freeze in mud to the marrow,
   then look his last on picardie.’
 
though bitter the word of these first twain
   curses the third spat venomously;
‘he’ll stay untouched till the war’s last dawning
   then live one hour of agony.’
 
liars the first two were. behold me
   at sloping arms by one – two – three;
waiting the time i shall discover
   whether the third spake verity.
