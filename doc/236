many months have passed
since the diagnosis,
and you’re still grieving for her.
she’s not dead yet.
but she’s lost, like a child is lost—
her mind the ocean floor,
where she kicks up sand
and churns in the water.
 
al, we call it, or ad—
never by its real name
as if mentioning the word would bring bad luck—
the need to cross one’s self across the heart,
throw back to the ocean half of one’s catch,
turn three times and pray to the east.
 
papa’s and her letters,
written during their courtship,
are tied with a faded, red ribbon
and sunk in a safe deposit box at bishop trust.
long ago, she gave them to you
for safekeeping. at the time
 
she exacted a promise from you,
that you would not read them
until she was dead.
we twist down the spiral staircase
curled like a strand of seaweed
into the cold room of vaults,
the heavy thud of door distinct as your sadness
following us everywhere. there,
you turn over the bundle of letters
in your hand like unbelievable money.
“i’m so tempted to read them,” you say.
 
you want her back,
the feisty and independent one,
the one who could, at eighty,
do ten knee bends in aerobics class,
dance a smooth jitterbug
and shuttle like the tide
to and from the house about her business.
not this elizabeth you mourn,
the one who can no longer reason,
who points and giggles at fat people
and smells, sometimes, like the ocean.
time slides like dali’s clock.
elizabeth is surprised
that she once was married and had a husband,
that she once gave birth to sons.
