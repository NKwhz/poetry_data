watching the dark my spirit rose in flood
   on that most dearest prelude of my delight.
the low-lying mist lifted its hood,
   the october stars showed nobly in clear night.
when i return, and to real music-making,
   and play that prelude, how will it happen then?
shall i feel as i felt, a sentry hardly waking,
   with a dull sense of no man's land again?
