oft, when my lips i open to rehearse
thy wondrous spell of wisdom, and of power,
and that my voice, and thy immortal verse,
on listening ears, and hearts, i mingled pour,
i shrink dismayed – and awful doth appear
the vain presumption of my own weak deed;
thy glorious spirit seems to mine so near,
that suddenly i tremble as i read –
thee an invisible auditor i fear:
oh, if it might be so, my master dear!
with what beseeching would i pray to thee,
to make me equal to my noble task,
succor from thee, how humbly would i ask,
thy worthiest works to utter worthily.
