when the end was near
he threatened   hands trembling
there is no end    never    his hands reaching to my face
you can’t leave   taking off his shirt   going for his pants
the trickle of sweat beading off his nose
moon-orb spray   metallic shimmer     slicklove
tripping numb night shadows
crows perched on a streetlight
we’re terrestrial ants living in fragility
on huhugam sacred ground
jar of our dead
like ragged cats my ghosts and i
gossip in the alley behind a bar
my eyes grasp theirs     a spark     revolution
feet without tracks on gravel
our existence erased   far off
from clinking beer bottles and vanity
on the bench outside a bookstore
we get erased    see the news of the street
resistance getting milled
my favorite ghosts and i bear down harder    birth ourselves
on the bench outside a bookstore
frigid wind wants to snatch our secrets
hey nay ya na ya na ya na
i thank you thank you for your presence
my ghosts   i thank you for your presence
hey nay ya na   ya na   ya na  ya na
this dilemma  oh ancestors
o! ancestors !!!!   i thank you  thank you  thank you
hey nay ya na ya na ya na ya na
i’m still the lipan jumano land-grant mongrel
nobody sees   nobody recognizes   an invisibility
scudding through all the checkpoints
border towns  train tracks  pesticide flybys   welfare lines
wings shifting shape
scorpion’s venom injects me for the night
green light spasms in the click click delete cut past
fucking do something  do something different
an orgasm of light at the slippery edge
one good time to die
and live spreading like osmosis
tripping grandmother rabbit on the moon
always with that sorrowful look on her face
make the medicine
be artistic
do what is necessary
