                      the rhinestone lights blink off and on.
pretend stars.
i'm sick of explanations. a life is like russell said
of electricity, not a thing but the way things behave.
a science of motion toward some flat surface,
some heat, some cold. some light
can leave some after-image but it doesn't last.
isn't that what they say? that and that
historical events exchange glances with nothingness.
