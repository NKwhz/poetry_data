in fort wayne i drank the seniors        old milwaukee
old crow         in indianapolis i stopped         now i regret
every drink i never took        all around          coffee grounds
and eggshells      this sweating         a mouthful
of  lime        as a boy i stole a mint green bra
from a laundromat       i took it home to try on
while my parents slept       filled its cups with the smallest
turnips in our pantry       the underwire grew
into me like a strangler fig       my blood roiled then
as now       back on earth frogspit is dripping
down wild aloe spikes       salmon are bullying
their way upstream       there is a pond i leapt into once
with a lonely blonde boy       when we scampered out one of us
was in love      i could not be held responsible
for desire       he could not be held at all     i wonder
where he is now       if he looked up he might see
me      a sparkling     i always hoped that when i died
i would know why        my brother will be so sad      he will tell
his daughter i was better than i was     he will leave out
my crueldrunk nights       the wet mattresses      my driving alone
into cornfields unsure whether i’d drive out       i wish
he were here now        he could be here      this cave
is big enough for everyone        look at all the diamonds
