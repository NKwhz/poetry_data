wintertime nighs;
but my bereavement-pain
it cannot bring again:
twice no one dies.
flower-petals flee;
but, since it once hath been,
no more that severing scene
can harrow me.
birds faint in dread:
i shall not lose old strength
in the lone frost's black length:
strength long since fled!
leaves freeze to dun;
but friends can not turn cold
this season as of old
for him with none.
tempests may scath;
but love can not make smart
again this year his heart
who no heart hath.
black is night's cope;
but death will not appal
one who, past doubtings all,
waits in unhope.
