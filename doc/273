tundra to the west in the park, past toklat

            castor and pollux i rebuilt that same summer —
            not superimposed, exact as any scheme

too many spots
soaked in unpronounceable latin.

tundra, under streets, in cadaver labs.

wistful orderly page after page in
biology, a lie, a kind of flip-book romance.

signing a paper, giving themselves away
