as if your half-witted tongue
spoke with an eloquence
death bestows, i heard your voice
muffled through the dark
layers of cemetery loam:
 
“they found me black-suited
in the shuttered half-dark, my eyes
dug like claws into the clouds’
soft feather-turnings. what kept me
separate the broiling sun
 
of intellect now shone on fiercely:
in the sheep-pens stinking
of dung and lanolin,
i buried my face in the ewe’s
swollen side and listened
 
for the lamb the way
the night sky listens
to the synapse-fire
of meteors, the fibrillating
heartbeat of the stars.
 
i heard the cells crackle
into being, the embryonic
brain begin to burn:
hunger. thirst. beneath my ear
my own disastrous birthing,
 
the umbilicus strangling
like a whip around my neck,
shoved through the momentary
breach memory tore open—
dying revealed to me my birth,
 
how half my brain went dark,
one side of a universe
pinched out like a candle:
just smart enough to sense
my difference, yet not know why—
 
even my death was the thrust
of a bewildering punchline: on thanksgiving
morning mouthwatering
pain shoved like a spit
from my bowels to my brain.”
