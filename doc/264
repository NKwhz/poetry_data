i was told that i was a sad man.
sadness is a fatal disease in this place
where happiness is a key to success.
if you are sad, you are doomed to fail—
you can’t please your boss,
your long face won’t attract customers,
a few sighs are enough
to let your friends down.
 
yesterday afternoon i met pham,
a vietnamese man who was once a general.
he came to this country
after nine years’ imprisonment.
now he works hard as a custodian
and always avoids
meeting his former soldiers here,
because every one of them
is doing better than he is.
“sadness,” he told me,
“is a luxury for me.
i have no time for it.
if i feel sad
i won’t be able to support my family.”
 
his words filled me with shame,
although i learned long ago
a busy bee feels no sorrow.
he made me realize i’m still a fortunate one
and ought to be happy and grateful
for having food in my stomach
and books to read.
 
i returned home humming a cheerful tune.
my wife smiled wondering
why i had suddenly become lighthearted.
my son followed me, laughing and frolicking,
while i was capering on the floor.
 
last night
i went to a party in my dream.
voices and laughter were drifting in a large hall
that was full of paintings and calligraphy.
strolling with ease
i ran into the handwriting of yours
hung in the air
piece by piece waving like wings.
dumbfounded, i turned
and saw you sitting on a chair,
motionless, the same lean detached face,
only your blue clothes had grown darker.
something snapped in my chest
and my tears flowed.
what’s the use of promising?
i have promised, a hundred times,
but never returned. wherever we go
our cause is the same:
to make a living and raise children.
if a poem arises, it’s merely
an accidental blessing.
 
for several hours my heart ached,
but i woke up—smiling.
