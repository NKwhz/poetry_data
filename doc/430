  lord,
              when you send the rain
              think about it, please,
              a little?
      do
              not get carried away
              by the sound of falling water,
              the marvelous light
              on the falling water.
          i
              am beneath that water.
              it falls with great force
              and the light
blinds
              me to the light.
