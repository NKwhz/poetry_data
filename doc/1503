death found strange beauty on that cherub brow,
and dash’d it out. – there was a tint of rose
o’er cheek and lip; – he touch’d the veins with ice,
and the rose faded. – forth from those blue eyes
there spake a wistful tenderness, – a doubt
whether to grieve or sleep, which innocence   
alone can wear. – with ruthless haste he bound
the silken fringes of their curtaining lids
forever. – there had been a murmuring sound
with which the babe would claim its mother’s ear,
charming her even to tears. – the spoiler set
his seal of silence. – but there beam’d a smile,
so fix’d and holy from that marble brow, –
death gazed and left it there; – he dared not steal
the signet-ring of heaven.
