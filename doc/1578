in her absence i created her image: out of the earthly
the hidden heavenly commences. i am here weighing
the expanse with the jahili odes ... and absence
is the guide, it is the guide. for each rhyme a tent
is pitched. and for each thing blowing in the wind
a rhyme. absence teaches me its lesson: if it weren’t
for the mirage you wouldn’t have been steadfast ...
then in the emptiness, i disassembled a letter from one
of the ancient alphabets, and i leaned on absence. so who am i
after the visitation? a bird, or a passerby amid the symbols
and the memory vendors? as if i were an antique piece,
as if i were a ghost sneaking in from yabous, telling myself:
let’s go to the seven hills. then i placed
my mask on a stone, and walked as the sleepless
walk, led by my dream. and from one moon
to another i leapt. there is enough of unconsciousness
to liberate things from their history. and there
is enough of history to liberate unconsciousness
from its ascension. take me to our early
years—my first girlfriend says. leave
the windows open for the house sparrow to enter
your dream—i say ... then i awaken, and no city is in
the city. no “here” except “there.” and no there
but here. if it weren’t for the mirage
i wouldn’t have walked to the seven hills ...
if it weren’t for the mirage!
