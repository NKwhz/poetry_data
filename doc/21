a boy i did not marry                  taught me to dance salsa on 2      placed
the fingers of his left hand            on my untutored spine;               you know what
it’s like to become someone’s clave
to love for the span           of the trombone’s long breath                  he      whispered
negra so i spun                my heart landing            on     the     rum-covered     linoleum
of a nightclub
on what used to be new york ave              in what used to be chocolate city
i let him turn & spin                                 my name             bella negra
             his hands were less tender but still i let them roam
              when i                  1, 2, 3             5, 6, 7     in front of my mirror
i was always la negra defended in the lyric                       and     you     can     forgive
searching hands when a mouth swells the biggest ache of your body
                                                                                                 into song
