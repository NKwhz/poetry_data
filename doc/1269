it's never enough being one. why do i hope
to contain you: always undoing and undone;
every place you touch me changes shape.
it's not my way to just lie down;
to sink, effaced and full. if you
swallow me, you're drained, and half
of us is gone. desire's fulfillment is two,
not one, or our tidal meetings are through.
so hurl your wet force forward, sea,
take me wave by wave. pearl maker, pull
me deep; our one's a need, a momentary
bliss. what i erect, you spillâ€”
castles, boulders, cliffs. my love's endurance
grain by grain; your adoration's rain.
touch my bones, my canyon's carved evidence.
even the moon who moves you is stone.
