there is no stillness in this wood.
the quiet of this clearing
is the denial of my hearing
the sounds i should.
there is no vision in this glade.
this tower of sun revealing
the timbered scaffoldage is stealing
essence from shade.
only my love is loveâ€™s ideal.
the love i could discover
in these recesses knows no lover,
is the unreal,
the undefined, unanalysed,
unabsolute many;
it is antithesis of any,
in none comprised.
