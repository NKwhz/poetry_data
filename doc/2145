traveling through the dark i found a deer
dead on the edge of the wilson river road.
it is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.
by glow of the tail-light i stumbled back of the car   
and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;   
she had stiffened already, almost cold.
i dragged her off; she was large in the belly.
my fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,   
alive, still, never to be born.
beside that mountain road i hesitated.
the car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;   
under the hood purred the steady engine.
i stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;   
around our group i could hear the wilderness listen.
i thought hard for us all—my only swerving—,   
then pushed her over the edge into the river.
