here is the house to hold me — cradle of all the race;
here is my lord and my love, here are my children dear —
here is the house enclosing, the dear-loved dwelling place;
why should i ever weary for aught that i find not here?
here for the hours of the day and the hours of the night;
bound with the bands of duty, rivetted tight;
duty older than adam — duty that saw
acceptance utter and hopeless in the eyes of the serving squaw.
food and the serving of food — that is my daylong care;
what and when we shall eat, what and how we shall wear;
soiling and cleaning of things — that is my task in the main —
soil them and clean them and soil them — soil them and clean them again.
to work at my trade by the dozen and never a trade to know;
to plan like a chinese puzzle — fitting and changing so;
to think of a thousand details, each in a thousand ways;
for my own immediate people and a possible love and praise.
my mind is trodden in circles, tiresome, narrow and hard,
useful, commonplace, private — simply a small back-yard;
and i the mother of nations! — blind their struggle and vain! —
i cover the earth with my children — each with a housewife's brain.
