nothing to tell why i cannot write
in re nobody; nobody to narrate this
latter acknowledgement: the self that counts
words to a line, accountable survivor
pain-wedged, pinioned in the cleft trunk,
less petty than a sprite, poisonous as ariel
to prospero's own knowledge. in my room
a vase of peacock feathers. i will attempt
to describe them, as if for evidence
on which a life depends. except for the eyes
they are threadbare, the threads hanging
as from a luminate tough weed in february.
but those eyesâ€”like a greek letter,
omega, fossiled in an indian shawl;
like a shaved cross section of living tissue,
the edge metallic blue, the core of jet,
the white of the eye in fact closer to beige,
the whole encircled with a black-fringed green.
the peacock roosts alone on a scots pine
at the garden end, in blustery twilight
his lambent cloak stark as a warlock's cape,
the maharajah-bird that scavenges
close by the stone-troughed, stone-terraced, stone-ensurfed
suffolk shoreline; at times displays his scream.
