eloquent
silence of everyone i ever loved
this cloudy friday evening
spring but still cold
a smattering of new buds
who's that
swaddled in
the uneasy atmosphere

no chatter or pleasant surprise
the lusty rush of a weekend
with the beloved

still hanging from their little chops
who is it straining
to pop out
of the hardwood
rings of time
into the cool air
like there's another cool world
on the other side of this one

is that
why we shake
