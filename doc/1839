this is my advice to foreigners:   
call it simplyâ€”the river;
never say old muddy
or even missouri,
and except when it is necessary   
ignore the fact that it moves.   
it is the river, a singular,
stationary figure of division.
do not allow the pre-socratic   
to enter your mind except
when thinking of clear water trout   
streams in north central wyoming.   
the river is a variety of land,   
a kind of dark sea or great bay,   
sea of greater ocean.
at times i find it good discipline   
to think of it as a tree
rooted in the delta,
a snake on its topmost western branch.   
these hills are not containers;   
they give no vantage but that   
looking out is an act of transit.   
we are not confused,
we do not lose our place.
