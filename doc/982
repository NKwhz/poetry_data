drawn in outer space
                            on a ceiling of night,
                                                        a hinged balance held true.
 
 
that balance
                            —its mechanisms
                                                        worked into the unknown—
 
 
emerged
                            in the star systems
                                                        which turn in union
 
 
without history
                            as we know it
                                                        on this planet.
 
 
i recognize it
                            to the east
                                                        said i to the west,
 
 
not made,
                            not given,
                                                        over the world.
 
 
devoted observers,
                            it seems to me
                                                        a just structure.

                            and my search
                                                        for peace underground
 
 
now come to an end
                            —constraints accepted
                                                        in spirit as well as in letter,
 
 
the line spent,
                            the theatres in abandon—
                                                        i viewed the balances
 
 
more clearly than ever before.
