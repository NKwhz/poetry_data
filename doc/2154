ye aspiring ones, listen to the story of the unknown
who lies here with no stone to mark the place.
as a boy reckless and wanton,
wandering with gun in hand through the forest
near the mansion of aaron hatfield,
i shot a hawk perched on the top
of a dead tree.
he fell with guttural cry
at my feet, his wing broken.
then i put him in a cage
where he lived many days cawing angrily at me
when i offered him food.
daily i search the realms of hades
for the soul of the hawk,
that i may offer him the friendship
of one whom life wounded and caged.
