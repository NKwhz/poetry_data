o wind, thou hast thy kingdom in the trees,
        and all thy royalties
        sweep through the land to-day.
              it is mid june,
and thou, with all thy instruments in tune,
              thine orchestra
of heaving fields and heavy swinging fir,
              strikest a lay
              that doth rehearse
her ancient freedom to the universe.
        all other sound in awe
              repeats its law:
        the bird is mute; the sea
        sucks up its waves; from rain
        the burthened clouds refrain,
to listen to thee in thy leafery,
              thou unconfined,
lavish, large, soothing, refluent summer wind.
