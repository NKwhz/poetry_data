when you finally, after deep illness, lay
the length of your body on mine, isn’t it
like the strata of the earth, the pressure
of time on sand, mud, bits of shell, all
the years, uncountable wakings, sleepings,
sleepless nights, fights, ordinary mornings
talking about nothing, and the brief
fiery plummets, and the unselfconscious
silences of animals grazing, the moving
water, wind, ice that carries the minutes, leaves
behind minerals that bind the sediment into rock.
how to bear the weight, with every
flake of bone pressed in. then, how to bear when
the weight is gone, the way a woman
whose neck has been coiled with brass
can no longer hold it up alone. oh love,
it is balm, but also a seal. it binds us tight
as the fur of a rabbit to the rabbit.
when you strip it, grasping the edge
of the sliced skin, pulling the glossy membranes
apart, the body is warm and limp. if you could,
you’d climb inside that wet, slick skin
and carry it on your back. this is not
neat and white and lacy like a wedding,
not the bright effervescence of champagne
spilling over the throat of the bottle. this visceral
bloody union that is love, but
beyond love. beyond charm and delight
the way you to yourself are past charm and delight.
this is the shucked meat of love, the alleys and broken
glass of love, the petals torn off the branches of love,
the dizzy hoarse cry, the stubborn hunger.
