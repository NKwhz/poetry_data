i am hoping
to hang your head
on my wall
in shame—
the slightest taxidermy
thrills me. fish
forever leaping
on the living-room wall—
paperweights made
from skulls
of small animals.
i want to wear
your smile on my sleeve
& break
your heart like a horse
or its leg. weeks of being
bucked off, then
all at once, you're mine—
put me down.
i want to call you thine
to tattoo mercy
along my knuckles. i assassin
down the avenue
i hope
to have you forgotten
by noon. to know you
by your knees
palsied by prayer.
loneliness is a science—
consider the taxidermist's
tender hands
trying to keep from losing
skin, the bobcat grin
of the living.
