as the dead, so i come
to the city i am of.
am without.
to watch play out around me
as theater —
audience as the dead are audience
to the life that is not mine.
is as not
as never.
turning down shiraz’s streets
it turns out to be such
a faraway thing.
a without which
i have learned to be.
from bed, i hear a man in the alley
selling something, no longer by mule and holler
but by bullhorn and jalopy.
how to say what he is selling —
it is no thing
this language thought worth naming.
no thing i have used before.
it is his
life i don’t see daily.
not theater. not play.
though i remain only audience.
it is a thing he must sell daily
and every day he peddles
this thing: a without which
i cannot name.
without which is my life.
