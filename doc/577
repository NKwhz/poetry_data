detective hardwood looks like batman this morning
pouty cupidy mouth
and a lot of black sculptural clanking
the statuary in my mortuary,
the masonic hall having burned again in dreams
but everyone still keeps skipping towards it
it's a hollow a round shell
my life as the shape of the ways i've been fucked
by prevailing thought & practice
all the conscious and unconscious sexisms
selfishnesses affluences assumptions suppressions in drift
get   rid   of   all   controls—is what the soul keeps screaming.

i sleep-walked in a dream to a man's apartment—
a man i'm doing business with—
i forgot, but how could i? how i'd gotten there,
and when i die will i remember all such forgotten things 
get   rid   of   the   controls
                                                                          i want to
remember now.
i apologized to the man for not adhering to office hours
it was four a.m. office hours are better he said.
don't arrive anywhere in your sleep
don't mix up night and day
soul and detective. no.

was so cruel and that never

those eyes saw raw smells and gods everywhere dusty
this dust i was truly assembled from
at least as you, we are communally
such.
if you say you'll hurt me, do you
really mean me
i  can't be, can i, hurt?

i have a drop of blood on a front tooth
i kind of don't mind—
this the list of what we've done:
         it was different structure we killed it
         put beasts in the refrigerator
         and that was almost as bad as my own enslavement.
         then i saw christ's blood pumped into a rejuvenating mummy.
         this great sickness we're part of apple clot
         and can you really chew it detective
         oh sure i can, i'm robert mitch-ham.
