scorn not the sonnet; critic, you have frowned,
mindless of its just honours; with this key
shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody
of this small lute gave ease to petrarch's wound;
a thousand times this pipe did tasso sound;
with it camöens soothed an exile's grief;
the sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf
amid the cypress with which dante crowned
his visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,
it cheered mild spenser, called from faery-land
to struggle through dark ways; and, when a damp
fell round the path of milton, in his hand
the thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
soul-animating strains—alas, too few!
