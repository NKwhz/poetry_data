standing aloof in giant ignorance,
   of thee i hear and of the cyclades,
as one who sits ashore and longs perchance
   to visit dolphin-coral in deep seas.
so thou wast blind;â€”but then the veil was rent,
   for jove uncurtain'd heaven to let thee live,
and neptune made for thee a spumy tent,
   and pan made sing for thee his forest-hive;
aye on the shores of darkness there is light,
   and precipices show untrodden green,
there is a budding morrow in midnight,
   there is a triple sight in blindness keen;
such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel
to dian, queen of earth, and heaven, and hell.
