let’s go out and buy something. in the sun.
 
no, let’s stay home and make something, the sun floods the room. it
could be green, on paper. it could be money. that’s the way to create
new matter.
 
that’s how i detach boats from moorings—my boat, my mooring—
     the harbor
shallow in low tide
 
skiff propelled over buffeting sands flats on
 
sheer
puissance.
