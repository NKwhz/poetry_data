what words or harder gift
does the light require of me
carving from the dark
this difficult tree?
what place or farther peace
do i almost see
emerging from the night
and heart of me?
the sky whitens, goes on and on.
fields wrinkle into rows
of cotton, go on and on.
night like a fling of crows
disperses and is gone.
what song, what home,
what calm or one clarity
can i not quite come to,
never quite see:
this field, this sky, this tree.
