and there are
two birds
in this poem
a loon
hand-carved
from balsa
and a snakebird
on the tide
of the river
the oily head
of a water bird
cuts surface
and glides
along by
tarred wooden
racks
ideograms
oyster farms
low on the tide
lower than
the hand-carved
loon it looks
hardly buoyant
a bird
from two
worlds it knows
the murk
on the bottom
and waves
crinkled by sun
it swims
as well
as a black trevally
sleek and fast
a challenge to
handcrafted birds
to all things made up
