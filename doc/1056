it is very hot—92 today—to be wearing
a stocking cap, but the adolescent swaggering
through the grocery store automatic door
doesn’t seem to mind; does not even appear
to be perspiring. the tugged-down hat
is part of his carefully orchestrated outfit:
bagging pants, screaming t-shirt, high-topped
shoes. the young woman who yells to her friends
from an open pickup window is attired
for summer season in strapless stretch
tube top, slipping down toward bountiful
cleavage valley. she tugs it up in front
as she races toward the two who have
just passed a cigarette between them
like a baton on a relay team. her white
chest gleams like burnished treasure
as they giggle loudly there in the corner
and i glance down to see what costume
i have selected to present myself to
the world today. i smile; it’s my sky blue
shirt with large deliberately faded peace sign,
smack dab in the middle, plus grey suede
birkenstocks—a message that “i lived through
the sixties and am so proud.” none of the
young look my way. i round the corner and
walk into evening descending.
