all sons sleep next to mothers, then alone, then with others
eventually, all our sons bare molars, incisors
meanwhile, mothers are wingless things in a room of stairs
a gymnasium of bars and ropes, small arms hauling self over self
mothers hum nonsense, driving here
and there (here! there!) in hollow steeds, mothers reflecting
how faint reflections shiver over the road
all the deafening musts along the way
mothers favor the moon—hook-hung and mirroring the sun—
there, in a berry bramble, calm as a stone
this is enough to wrench our hand out of his
and simply devour him, though he exceeds even the tallest grass
every mother recalls a lullaby, and the elegy blowing through it
