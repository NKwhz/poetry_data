newsmen call it the cuban missile crisis.
teachers say it's the end of the world.
at school, they instruct us to look up
and watch the cuban-cursed sky.
search for a streak of light.
listen for a piercing shriek,
the whistle that will warn us
as poisonous a-bombs
zoom close.
hide under a desk.
pretend that furniture is enough
to protect us against perilous flames.
radiation. contamination. toxic breath.
each air-raid drill is sheer terror,
but some of the city kids giggle.
they don't believe that death
is real.
they've never touched a bullet,
or seen a vulture, or made music
by shaking
the jawbone
of a mule.
when i hide under my frail school desk,
my heart grows as rough and brittle
as the slab of wood
that fails to protect me
from reality's
gloom.
