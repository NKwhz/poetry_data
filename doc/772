opposite him at this table again
and through the windows the city glittering, surreal as a scale model,
the city in miniature — only it moves in a real way, because it is real.
one of the windows is open, some construction down on the street
drones like a distant vacuum. it’s warm for january.
still, his apartment has that dreamlike quality
of feeling like home though i know it’s not. not mine anymore —
but how many people get to visit the past without hurting anything?
to come back and drink the same coffee
from the same never-quite-clean cup?
