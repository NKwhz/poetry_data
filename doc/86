in homer, the gods
take the place of consciousness.
for me, it is birds.
gray gulls
seen from above,
a tan and white pigeon
bringing amoral intelligence
to the balcony wall.
geoff says they are really getting tough on birds
in brighton. bringing in a bylaw.
i remember his balcony
it’s really just the roof of the room downstairs
but when you climb out the window
you get a view of the sea
and the ferris wheel
which i believe is gone, or going
it was an eyesore
all the locals said
though i — of course —
thought it was wonderful
and the burned-down pier
out in the water.
