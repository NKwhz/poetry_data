the heat of autumn
is different from the heat of summer.   
one ripens apples, the other turns them to cider.   
one is a dock you walk out on,   
the other the spine of a thin swimming horse
and the river each day a full measure colder.   
a man with cancer leaves his wife for his lover.
before he goes she straightens his belts in the closet,   
rearranges the socks and sweaters inside the dresser
by color. thatâ€™s autumn heat:
her hand placing silver buckles with silver,   
gold buckles with gold, setting each   
on the hook it belongs on in a closet soon to be empty,   
and calling it pleasure.
