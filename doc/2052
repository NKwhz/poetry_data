they are all gone away,
the house is shut and still,
there is nothing more to say.
through broken walls and gray
the winds blow bleak and shrill:
they are all gone away.
nor is there one to-day
to speak them good or ill:
there is nothing more to say.
why is it then we stray
around the sunken sill?
they are all gone away,
and our poor fancy-play
for them is wasted skill:
there is nothing more to say.
there is ruin and decay
in the house on the hill:
they are all gone away,
there is nothing more to say.
