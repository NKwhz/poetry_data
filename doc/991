how should i now recall
the icy lace of the pane
like a sheet of cellophane,
or the skies of alcohol
poured over the saltbox town?
on that stony new england tableau,
the halo of falling snow
glared like a waxy crown.
through blue frozen lots
my giant parents strolled,
wrapped tight against the cold
like woolen argonauts,
searching for that tall
perfection of scotch pine
from the hundreds laid in line
like the dead at guadalcanal.
the clapboard village aglow
that starry stark december
i barely now remember,
or the brutish ache of snow
burning my face like quicklime.
yet one thing was still missing.
i saw my parents kissing,
perhaps for the last time.
