the scientists are in terror
            and the european mind stops
wyndham lewis chose blindness
            rather than have his mind stop.
night under wind mid garofani,
            the petals are almost still
mozart, linnaeus, sulmona,
when one’s friends hate each other
            how can there be peace in the world?
their asperities diverted me in my green time.
a blown husk that is finished
            but the light sings eternal
a pale flare over marshes
                where the salt hay whispers to tide’s change
time, space,
          neither life nor death is the answer.
and of man seeking good,
            doing evil.
in meiner heimat
                   where the dead walked
                              and the living were made of cardboard.
