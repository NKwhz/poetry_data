he worked years on the tablet,
deciphering the pictographs. he knew
it was a kind of language, those images.
an eye. a bird, maybe a crow.
a basket of wheat. a ladder.
did the order of the images matter?
he cross-referenced similar texts.
he studied the history of the region
and satisfied many hours in the tablet's service.
in a cousin language, a ladder
was the word for happiness, to rise up,
to be lifted above the ordinary.
after years of work, he sorted it out.
it was poetry, bad poetry, adolescent:
"today, i am happy,
happy all this day, today."
