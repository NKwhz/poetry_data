her face          her tongue       her wit
so fair             so sweet          so sharp
first bent         then drew         then hit
mine eye         mine ear          my heart
mine eye         mine ear          my heart
to like             to learn            to love
her face          her tongue       her wit
doth lead         doth teach       doth move
her face          her tongue       her wit
with beams      with sound       with art
doth blind       doth charm       doth knit
mine eye         mine ear          my heart
mine eye         mine ear          my heart
with life          with hope         with skill
her face         her tongue       her wit
doth feed       doth feast         doth fill
o face            o tongue          o wit
with frowns      with checks      with smart
wrong not       vex not            wound not
mine eye         mine ear          my heart
this eye         this ear            this heart
shall joy         shall yield          shall swear
her face          her tongue         her wit
to serve          to trust             to fear.
