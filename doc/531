down by the pond, addicts sleep
on rocky grass half in water, half out,
and there the moon lights them
out of tawny silhouettes into the rarest
of amphibious flowers i once heard called striders,
between, but needing, two worlds.
of what can you accuse them now,
                                                     beauty?
