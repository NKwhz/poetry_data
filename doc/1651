it seems i get by on more luck than sense,
not the kind brought on by knuckle to wood,
breath on dice, or pennies found in the mud.
i shimmy and slip by on pure fool chance.
at turns charmed and cursed, a girl knows romance
as coffee, red wine, and books; solitude
she counts as daylight virtue and muted
evenings, the inventory of absence.
but this is no sorry spinster story,
just the way days string together a life.
sometimes i eat soup right out of the pan.
sometimes i donâ€™t care if i will marry.
i dance in my kitchen on friday nights,
singing like only a lucky girl can.
