my brother is dying and i am not.
i drag him behind me like a spiritless balloon, like the first robot,
like the last clown-car clown, his ridiculous fiat, his lot
to be crushed, left for dead, covered in snot,
his puffy hands, his outsized shoes, his flower pot,
like virgil earp, clanton-ganged, at the not
ok corral, un-brothered, gutshot,
like the night without sleep in turandot.
from the get-go i have always sought
to know (what, what?) if this is all i’ve got,
to show up in a vestibule, all bothered and hot,
like silver-fingered iscariot,
like the smiling highwayman, tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot,
while all about me are consigned to slather and rot.
i drink to my faith, to what i am not,
to all who’ve come before me, every rutty lancelot,
every huguenot, every hotsy-totsy hot to trot, every dylan, besot,
who doesn’t have the strength to get up and take another shot.
i know my morse, code blue, dot-dot-dot, dit-dit-dit, dot-dot-dot.
i know what god hath wrought.
