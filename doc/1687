the nurse-life wheat within his green husk growing,
flatters our hope, and tickles our desire,
nature’s true riches in sweet beauties showing,
which sets all hearts, with labor’s love, on fire.
no less fair is the wheat when golden ear
shows unto hope the joys of near enjoying;
fair and sweet is the bud, more sweet and fair
the rose, which proves that time is not destroying.
caelica, your youth, the morning of delight,
enamel’d o’er with beauties white and red,
all sense and thoughts did to belief invite,
that love and glory there are brought to bed;
      and your ripe year’s love-noon; he goes no higher,
      turns all the spirits of man into desire.
