i have no illusion
some fusion

bewilderment

shooting through a hell
               of ratty alleys
where nothing thrives
but soot
              and the ratlike lives
that have learned to eat it
screechingly peacocked
a grace of sparks
              so far out and above
the fast curve that jostled
and fastened us

i will not call it love
but at least some brief
and no doubt illusionary belief
               that in one surge of brain
we were all seeing
one thing:
                a lone unearned loveliness
struck from an iron pain.
already it was gone.
already it was bone,
              the gray sky
and the encroaching skyline

and division.
and yet all that day
              i had a kind of vision
that's never gone completely away
of immense clear-paned towers
and endlessly expendable hours
               through which i walked
teeming human streets,
filled with a shine
              that was most intimately me
and not mine.
