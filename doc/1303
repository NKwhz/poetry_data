if no one ever marries me,—
and i don't see why they should,
for nurse says i'm not pretty,
and i'm seldom very good—
if no one ever marries me
i shan't mind very much;
i shall buy a squirrel in a cage,
and a little rabbit-hutch:
i shall have a cottage near a wood,
and a pony all my own,
and a little lamb quite clean and tame,
that i can take to town:
and when i'm getting really old,—
at twenty-eight or nine—
i shall buy a little orphan-girl
and bring her up as mine.
