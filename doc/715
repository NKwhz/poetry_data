only this boy moves
between the runes of trees
on his tricycle
when an eagle swoops,
releases two arrows
from its silver wings, and melts
away faster than lightning.
then a loud whistle
and a bang like dry thunder.
in a blink the boy sees
his house roof sink.
feels his ears ripped off.
the blast puffs up a fawn smoke
bigger than a mountain cloud.
the slow begonias rattle
their scarlet like confetti.
metal slashes
the trees and ricochets.
wires and pipes snap
at the roots, quiver.
the whirling smoke packed
with bricks and cement,
chicken feathers and nigella seeds.
when the cloud begins
to settle on the ground,
the boy makes out buckled iron rods.
white soot descends
and he finds himself dressed
like an apprentice baker.
