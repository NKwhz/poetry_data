                                  i
to dream of love, and, waking, to remember you:
as though, being dead, one dreamed of heaven, and woke
      in hell.
at night my lovely dreams forget the old farewell:
ah! wake not by his side, lest you remember too!
                                  ii
i set all rome between us: with what joy i set
the wonder of the world against my world's delight!
rome, that hast conquered worlds, with intellectual might
capture my heart, and teach my memory to forget!
