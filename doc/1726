1
come, my lucasia, since we see
that miracles mens faith do move,
by wonder and by prodigy
to the dull angry world let’s prove
there’s a religion in our love.
2
for though we were design’d t’ agree,
that fate no liberty destroyes,
but our election is as free
as angels, who with greedy choice
are yet determin’d to their joyes.
3
our hearts are doubled by the loss,
here mixture is addition grown ;
we both diffuse, and both ingross :
and we whose minds are so much one,
never, yet ever are alone.
4
we court our own captivity
than thrones more great and innocent :
’twere banishment to be set free,
since we wear fetters whose intent
not bondage is, but ornament.
5
divided joyes are tedious found,
and griefs united easier grow :
we are our selves but by rebound,
and all our titles shuffled so,
both princes, and both subjects too.
6
our hearts are mutual victims laid,
while they (such power in friendship lies)
are altars, priests, and off’rings made :
and each heart which thus kindly dies,
grows deathless by the sacrifice.
