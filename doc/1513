in front of the craft shop,
a small nativity,
mother, baby, sheep
made of white
and blue balloons.
                  *
sky
           god
                      girl.
pick out the one
that doesnâ€™t belong.
                  *
some thing
close to nothing
                               flat
from which,
fatherless,
everything has come.
