how can i, that girl standing there,
my attention fix
on roman or on russian
or on spanish politics,
yet here's a travelled man that knows
what he talks about,
and there's a politician
that has both read and thought,
and maybe what they say is true
of war and war's alarms,
but o that i were young again
and held her in my arms.
