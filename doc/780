all morning my daughter pleading, outside
outside. by noon i kneel to button her
coat, tie the scarf to keep her hood in place.
this is her first snow so she strains against
the ritual, spooked silent then whining,
restless under each buffeting layer,
uncertain how to settle into this
leashing. i manage at last to tunnel
her hands into mittens and she barks and
wonâ€™t stop barking, her hands suddenly paws.
she is reduced to another being,
barking, barking all day in these restraints.
for days after, she howls into her hands,
the only way she tells me she wants out.
