starspangled cowboy
sauntering out of the almost-
silly west, on your face
a porcelain grin,
tugging a papier-mâché cactus
on wheels behind you with a string,
you are innocent as a bathtub
full of bullets.
your righteous eyes, your laconic
trigger-fingers
people the streets with villains:
as you move, the air in front of you
blossoms with targets
and you leave behind you a heroic
trail of desolation:
beer bottles
slaughtered by the side
of the road, bird-
skulls bleaching in the sunset.
i ought to be watching
from behind a cliff or a cardboard storefront
when the shooting starts, hands clasped
in admiration,
but i am elsewhere.
then what about me
what about the i
confronting you on that border,
you are always trying to cross?
i am the horizon
you ride towards, the thing you can never lasso
i am also what surrounds you:
my brain
scattered with your
tincans, bones, empty shells,
the litter of your invasions.
i am the space you desecrate
as you pass through.
