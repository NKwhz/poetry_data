my spirit is too weak—mortality
   weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
   and each imagined pinnacle and steep
of godlike hardship tells me i must die
like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
   yet ’tis a gentle luxury to weep
   that i have not the cloudy winds to keep
fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye.
such dim-conceived glories of the brain
   bring round the heart an undescribable feud;
so do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
   that mingles grecian grandeur with the rude
wasting of old time—with a billowy main—
   a sun—a shadow of a magnitude.
