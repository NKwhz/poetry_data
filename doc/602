so why assume [she]
is cold why not
assume drunk
“legless”
can keep up pretty good though
with your car in the rural night
you are a passenger
your left leg lolls and
your friend reaches a hand
across the emergency brake
which points now at the base of
the gearstick shaft
and can point at its head
but nowhere else
thus does not
“speak”
and unless overused abused is
reliable
whereas anyone can misunderstand
or willfully misinterpret the

6am and the snow
sent enough light upward
for this window to
transmit and permit
my seeing
i heard more than i saw
i understood less than i heard
i was well read compared to
but not compared to
i begin to feel warm in
my crotch, as if a wodge
of moist electric blanket
were stuck in there
and my friend was not
riding on the other side of the brake
—i mean emergency—he is not
fox-hunting and on
a horse in a novel
in which the brake
is a strip of greenwood
he is downstairs  the coffee’s
made  but he ignores
my text   he works alone
and i will have to go down there
