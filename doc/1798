come here’s
a peach he said
and held it out just far
enough to reach beyond his lap
and off-
ered me
a room the one
room left he said in all
of thessaloniki that night
packed with
traders
the peach was lush
i hadn’t slept for days
it was like velvet lips a lamp
he smiled
patted
the bed for me
i knew it was in fact
the only room the only bed
the peach
trembled
and he said come
nodding to make me
agree i wanted the peach and
the bed
he said
to take it see
how nice it was and i
thought how i could take it ginger-
ly my
finger-
tips only touch-
ing only it not in
or out i stayed in the doorway
watching
a fly
he stroked the peach
and asked where i was from
i said the states he smiled and asked
how long
i’d stay
the fly had found
the peach i said i’d leave
for turkey in the morning i
wanted
so much
to sleep and on
a bed i thought of all
the ways to say that word
and that
they must
have gradient
meanings he asked me did
i want the peach and i said sure
and took
it from
his hand he asked
then if i’d take the room
it costs too much i said and turned
to go
he said
to stay a while
and we could talk the sun
was going down i said no thanks
i’d head
out on
the late train but
could i still have the peach
and what else could he say to that
but yes
