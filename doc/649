traffic was heavy coming off the bridge,
and i took the road to the right, the wrong one,
and got stuck in the car for hours.
most nights i rushed out into the evening
without paying attention to the trees,
whose names i didn't know,
or the birds, which flew heedlessly on.
i couldn't relinquish my desires
or accept them, and so i strolled along
like a tiger that wanted to spring
but was still afraid of the wildness within.
the iron bars seemed invisible to others,
but i carried a cage around inside me.
i cared too much what other people thought
and made remarks i shouldn't have made.
i was silent when i should have spoken.
forgive me, philosophers,
i read the stoics but never understood them.
i felt that i was living the wrong life,
spiritually speaking,
while halfway around the world
thousands of people were being slaughtered,
some of them by my countrymen.
so i walked on—distracted, lost in thought—
and forgot to attend to those who suffered
far away, nearby.
forgive me, faith, for never having any.
i did not believe in god,
who eluded me.
