after the murder, i called a meeting
to see if we were happy. i declared
i was not — i said i liked the man
we shot. you all disagreed with this.
i asked if you knew him, his wife,
none of you did. “kill me, then,”
i said. you all stared at me. “why,
bernard? of course we won’t.”
“why not?” i said. “he was a good
man, a better man than me. and
look at what i’ve brought you —
rubbish, dodgy tales, dross.”
“easy to dismiss that,” you said.
“we appreciated it all. and you
wandered the wild paths to bring
it back to us — your songs, your
legends, magic stories, your gold.”
i thanked you, but shook my head.
the good man was dead. i didn’t care
what i’d brought you. i needed to go.
i packed up my sagas, my song lyrics,
my alchemy potions, my gold, and
i disappeared.
