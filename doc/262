we sat in the neon light
on a cool evening of a summer day
drinking beer and eating salad.
you told me your story
similar to those of many others:
all your savings are gone,
the managers, the secretaries, the supervisors,
the police in charge of passports
all having received a handsome share.
now you have nothing left there,
your color tv and refrigerator were sold
to get the cash for the plane ticket.
 
“but i was lucky,” you assured me.
“many people have spent fortunes
and still cannot leave the country.”
 
“what are you going to do here?
don’t think this is a place where
you can make a fortune by snapping fingers.
starting poor, we have to labor for every dollar.
it is a place where money
can hire the devil to make bean curd
and your growth is measured by financial figures.
there is no way for us to get beyond
a social security number.”
 
“anything, i would do anything,
as long as i can make a living.
at least, i am free here and don’t
hate others. do you know what i wanted
when i was back there?
i always imagined how to get a gun
so i could shoot all the bastards.
that country is not a place to live—
i would rather die than go back.”
 
we stopped to watch seagulls.
an airplane was writing the word
fun in the distant sky.
i wish i had left the same way,
but i brought with me all my belongings,
even my army mug and a bunch of old letters.
