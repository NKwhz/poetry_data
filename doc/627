the brook is this mix of roar & hiss as if god
has managed to scalpel a section of tempest & clothespin it in
the woods over there always draped in the trees
while we eat white summer peaches from celadon bowls
while the sun bleaches & blue jay squawks score the maple, oak
birch and apple-treed sky with their oblique scriabin musics.
fifteen years since i have seen a real fall
her deciduous burlesque, her glistering things sifting
on the old cider mill. a holy show.
i hold a wooden fragrance & a sodden mush of crushed
flowing apples in a cache and will never give it up.
the cardinal is the best bird because it is a red mark
on the blank snow amid the charcoal twombly of maple, oak
birch and apple branches. pines are green & faraway, donâ€™t figure.
my sister in spring is even prettier, her smile
the genuine quality of it undiminished in the many months
since i have been in happy valley. it roars and is constantly
in spate because it has its reasons spring being spring plus my visiting.
