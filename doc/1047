methinks 'tis pretty sport to hear a child,
rocking a word in mouth yet undefiled.
the tender racket rudely plays the sound,
which weakly banded cannot back rebound,
and the soft air the softer roof does kiss,
with a sweet dying and a pretty miss,
which hears no answer yet from the white rank
of teeth, not risen from their coral bank.
the alphabet is searched for letters soft,
to try a word before it can be wrought,
and when it slides forth, it goes as nice,
as when a man does walk upon the ice.
