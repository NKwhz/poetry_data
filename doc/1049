i have to leave early in the dark
and hungry to avoid
crossing the snow as the noon
 
burns the crust
into an un-servable lake
slush instead of the crisp bridge
 
that would be in order
to get me over the ridge
 
my journal is already laundered clean
of my words      and my instructions
have dissolved
 
into a white mash       a washed bone
ball         rolled into itself
of all i have in the world       in my pocket
 
 
the ink is thin the paper is poor
my eyes balance on the pale
words around which a stream
 
flows     almost erasing
the way across
the idea
 
shadows         the black flowers
of the light self
-sowing through the trees
 
dark gardens        of midnight
for the gray-white morning
hour        of blindness
 
in print miles before i am
to arrive        here
 
to approach the waiting milestone
dims whatever else of its lantern
‘til only the placed light there is on me.
 
in this light       barely      but used to it
i can make out the staggered columns of my account
as if back through weren’t the real distance:
 
the thin chest flag pinned on by each ridge
the titled introduction taking your coat each storm.
 
 
my letters and ribbons have been the natural—
strengths on their way to the more—
natural weaknesses—         and loss.        yet—
 
i wonder where i thought i was going—
to ’ve done what you must pass
examinations for before i took any.
