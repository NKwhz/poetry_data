there is a drear and lonely tract of hell
from all the common gloom removed afar:
a flat, sad land it is, where shadows are,
whose lorn estate my verse may never tell.
i walked among them and i knew them well:
men i had slandered on life's little star
for churls and sluggards; and i knew the scar
upon their brows of woe ineffable.
but as i went majestic on my way,
into the dark they vanished, one by one,
till, with a shaft of god's eternal day,
the dream of all my glory was undone,â€”
and, with a fool's importunate dismay,
i heard the dead men singing in the sun.
