i’ve never seen the land
of milk and honey, but at
the iowa state fair i glimpsed
a cow fashioned of butter.
it lived behind a window
in an icy room, beneath klieg lights.
i filed past as one files
past a casket at a wake.
it was that sad: a butter cow
without a butter calf. nearby i spied
a butter motorcycle, motorcycle-
sized, a mechanical afterthought
i thought the cow might have liked to ride.
you don’t drive a motorcycle; you ride it.
but not if you’re a butter cow, not
if you’re a butter cow who’s seen, if
not the land of milk and honey, the land
of milk, and dwelled within it.
it had a short life span, the butter cow.
before it died, i looked
deep into its butter eyes. it saw
my butter soul. i could
have wept, or spread myself,
for nobody, across dry toast.
