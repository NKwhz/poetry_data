i placed a jar in tennessee,
and round it was, upon a hill.
it made the slovenly wilderness
surround that hill.
the wilderness rose up to it,
and sprawled around, no longer wild.
the jar was round upon the ground
and tall and of a port in air.
it took dominion everywhere.
the jar was gray and bare.
it did not give of bird or bush,
like nothing else in tennessee.
