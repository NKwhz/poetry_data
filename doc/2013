dance little baby, dance up high,
never mind baby, mother is by ;
crow and caper, caper and crow,
there little baby, there you go ;
up to the ceiling, down to the ground,
backwards and forwards, round and round ;
dance little baby, and mother shall sing,
with the merry coral, ding, ding, ding.
