horace iv. i
it’s over, love. look at me pushing fifty now,
    hair like grave-grass growing in both ears,
the piles and boggy prostate, the crooked penis,
    the sour taste of each day’s first lie,
and that recurrent dream of years ago pulling
    a swaying bead-chain of moonlight,
of slipping between the cool sheets of dark
    along a body like my own, but blameless.
what good’s my cut-glass conversation now,
    now i’m so effortlessly vulgar and sad?
you get from life what you can shake from it?
    for me, it’s g and t’s all day and cnn.
try the blond boychick lawyer, entry level
    at eighty grand, who pouts about overtime,
keeps evian and a beeper in his locker at the gym,
    and hash in tinfoil under the office fern.
there’s your hound from heaven, with buccaneer
    curls and perfumed war-paint on his nipples.
his answering machine always has room for one more
    slurred, embarrassed call from you-know-who.
some nights i’ve laughed so hard the tears
    won’t stop. look at me now. why now?
i long ago gave up pretending to believe
    anyone’s memory will give as good as it gets.
so why these stubborn tears? and why do i dream
    almost every night of holding you again,
or at least of diving after you, my long-gone,
    through the bruised unbalanced waves?
