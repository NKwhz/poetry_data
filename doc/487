on mother's day it isn't smart
to give your mom a broken heart.
so here are thing you shouldn't say
to dear old mom on mother's day:
don't tell here that you'll never eat
a carrot, celery, bean, or beet.
don't tell her you think smoking's cool.
don't tell her you've dropped out of school.
don't tell her that you've drowned the cat.
don't tell her that she looks too fat.
dont't tell her when you're grown you'll be
a starving poetâ€”just like me.
