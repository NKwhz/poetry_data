day after day of rain. a ticket straight to
the mild-mannered hell of rethinking whatever,
the drive to econofoods: not a lot of grief in that.
you need staples — bread, rice, eggs.
here’s a list: almonds, yogurt, all the little
anti-griefs add up.
did i tell you? my grandfather sings from the grave.
they have my old philco here.
i know all about your world of godawful and too bad.
i keep driving. in rain. some luck required. stop light.
flashy cars on both sides playing radios too loud.
ear damage! i used to shout out the window,
my boy in the front seat trying hard to shrink, not to know
who is that crazy at the wheel.
grandfather likes saying: what? half-deaf even now.
half a lot of things, anytime. half, what gives?
giving way. if there is a we or a you or an i finally.
he’d cup an ear if he had an ear.
so it is, the first anti-grief, a feather he picked up.
my childhood, walking with
the oldest man i ever, 1874 his
start date. alarm and should have, two roads
he would not cross, and consequence
a street over, he ignored completely. always
an eye out for the great
small peculiar.
a feather. sometimes handed to me. or he’d
oil a clock with it right off the curb.
into a pocket.
