big smelly bowel movements this blue january morning.
from the living room tv, a commercial from our tv company: we’re the fastest, the only —
meaning, love us above all others.
what makes poop more pungent on certain days?
a question for science.
from the living room tv: the powerful cite law, bark order —
meaning, love us or else.
years ago, a teacher said never to use the word “poop” in a poem.
today, the icy kiss of the toilet seat wakes me up.
today, i poop while my boyfriend shouts from the living room, did you hear that, meaning the atomic scientists who say we are now two & a half minutes to midnight.
but still i marvel whenever poop comes out as one true platonic tube.
i am trying to be marvelous.
& to make my enemies throw up.
i mean, if you shower with soap & eat well, maintaining consistent gastrointestinal health, you should be ready for a rimjob or other forms of anal play.
my boyfriend & i are not platonic.
from the tv: a white supremacist cites science, barks two sides to every —
i mean, up the throat, out the mouth: the fastest, the only way the powerful will let go of their shit.
i mean, my boyfriend & i are not into scat but if you are i hope your beloved produces the most fragrant, citrusy shit.
i mean, is “shit” more or less literary than “poop”?
i mean, one winter night i got sick & pooped the bed.
& he just got up with me.
helped strip the sheets, carry it all to the washer.
i kept saying, i’m so sorry, shivering, i’m so, i’m sorry. but he said, what? hey. i love you.
