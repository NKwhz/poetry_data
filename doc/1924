our sweet companionsâ€”sharing your bunk and your bed
the versts and the versts and the versts and a hunk of your bread
the wheels' endless round
the rivers, streaming to ground   
the road. . .
oh the heavenly the gypsy the early dawn light
remember the breeze in the morning, the steppe silver-bright
wisps of blue smoke from the rise
and the song of the wise   
gypsy czar. . .
in the dark midnight, under the ancient trees' shroud
we gave you sons as perfect as night, sons
as poor as the night
and the nightingale chirred   
your might. . .
we never stopped you, companions for marvelous hours
poverty's passions, the impoverished meals we shared
the fierce bonfire's glow
and there, on the carpet below,   
fell stars. . .
