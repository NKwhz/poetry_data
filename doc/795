bubblegum lip gloss kissed,                our lifelines, our mirrors,
i was never a singkil princess            these are luminous mysteries —
knuckle cracking, polished toes,        our notebooks, our language,
i was never a santacruzan queen      to witness, to make way,
black eyeliner, push up bra                  our thirst and our wedding bands —
i was never a curtsying debutante    to fill stone jars with water, to wed,
loud, gum-smacking babygirl             our glamour and our armor.
i was never a tiaraed miss fil am     to transfigure, dazzling as the sun.
