from back when it was nam time i tell you what.
them days men boys gone dark groves rose like vietnam bamboo.
aftergrowth something awful.
green have mercy souls here seen camouflage everlasting.
nary a one of the brung-homes brung home whole.
mongst tar-pines come upon this box-thing worked from scrapwood.
puts me much myself in mind of a rabbit-crouch.
is it more a meat-safe.
set there hid bedded there looking all the world like a coffin.
somebody cares to tend to it like a spring gets tendered clears the leaves!
whosoever built it set wire window-screen down the sides.
long about five foot or thereabouts close kin to a dog-crate.
a human would have to hunch.
closes over heavy this hingey-type lid on it like a casket.
swearing to jesus wadn't it eye-of-pine laid down for the floor.
remembering the garner twins carl and charlie come home mute.
cherry-bombs 4th of july them both belly-scuttling under the house.
their crave of pent-places ditchpipes.
mongst tar-pines come upon this box-thing worked from scrapwood.
from back when it was nam time i tell you what.
