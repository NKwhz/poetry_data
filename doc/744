this ploughman dead in battle slept out of doors
many a frosty night, and merrily
answered staid drinkers, good bedmen, and all bores:
'at mrs greenland's hawthorn bush,' said he,
'i slept.' none knew which bush. above the town,
beyond 'the drover', a hundred spot the down
in wiltshire. and where now at last he sleeps
more sound in franceâ€”that, too, he secret keeps.
