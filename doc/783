shiraishi called upon the great sky cock,
wanted an explanation, wondered, why
the echo of form without the wisdom,
why the bent wit without the timing.
wondered, as i have, how a man, bare
upon the bed may rise as if in praise
but fail to be grateful for the gift at hand.
o dick of questionable devise.
o schlong of longing, as present
but ultimately unknowable as your
maker, i would worship at the fount
if i had more faith, if i knew your
weeping eye was on me alone.
