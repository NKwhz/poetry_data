    broadway
past lincoln
     center and the wind
 
is up so seems
     to speak
saw you
 
     through the glass
standing in line
     i swear a quiver
 
played
     on your lips
you were
 
     leafing through his book…
—years
     it’s been years
 
since corona
     heights, backing
into him: dribble,
 
     hook, swish…
…that beige
     comfy couch,
 
sipping a stem
     of wine, his cat
in my lap
 
* * *
 
the townhouse
saturday night—shoulder
 
to shoulder pushing
toward the piano he
 
stops to squeeze
by; his eyes  mine
 
clench  unclench…
…what was it we found
 
in common over
drink   smoke   talk?
 
a college campus
—his son, his daughter
 
 
* * *
 
earlier that night i rose
to the city’s surface
steam through the grate, crossed
crossed again down 7th
 
past carnegie hall, the greek
joint as imagined, chic
—unlike the shirt
d wore (the fur
 
of his arms) at castro
and market waiting
for the light: words were struck
like steel and flint
 
that distant august day…then
his visit to spain, mine
to new canaan—walking
through the morgan
 
with him. and what
our mouths unfurled
across a table of olives
years later—last night…
 
dropping me off at 58th he
reaches for the door
i’m fumbling to open, leans
close and plants
 
what i’ve missed
 
all these years
