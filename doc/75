our teacher gave detention
to the fountains in the hall.
she handed extra homework
to the artwork on the wall.
 
we saw her point a finger
at a banner and a sign.
she said their bad behavior
was completely out of line.
 
the principal approached her
and said, “what is all this fuss?
i heard you tried to punish
all the tires on a bus.
 
“you’ve made the teachers angry
by disrupting all their classes,
so if you want to keep this job,
you have to wear your glasses!”
