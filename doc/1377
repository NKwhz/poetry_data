the food is on the table. turkey tanned
to a cowboy boot luster, potatoes mashed
and mounded in a bowl whose lip is lined
with blue flowers linked by grey vines faded
from washing. everyone’s heads have turned
to elongate the table’s view—a last supper twisted
toward a horizon where the christmas tree, crowned
by a window, sets into itself half inclined.   
each belly cries. each pair of eyes admonished
by aunt photographer. look up. you’re wined
and dined for the older folks who’ve pined
to see your faces, your lives, lightly framed
in this moment’s flash. parents are moved,
press their children’s heads up from the table,
hide their hunger by rubbing lightly wrinkled
hands atop their laps. they’ll hold the image
as long as need be, seconds away from grace.
