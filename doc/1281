after the cling of roots and then the “pock”
when they gave way
                                     the recoil up the hand
               was a small shock
of emptiness beginning to expand.
milk frothing from the stems. leaves inky green
and spiked.
                      like blissed-out childhood play
              turned mean
they snarled in tangled curls on our driveway.
it happens still. that desolating falling
shudder inside
                            and then our neighborhood
                seems only sprawling
loops...like the patterns eaten on driftwood:
even the home where i grew up (its smell
of lingering
                      wood-smoke and bacon grease)
             seems just a shell
of lathe and paper. but this strange release
follows: this tinge like silver and i feel
the pull of dirt
                            again, sense mist uncurling
               to reveal
no architecture hidden behind the world
except the stories that we make unfolding:
as if our sole real power
                                                    were the power
             of children holding
this flower that is a weed that is a flower.
