harry loves myrtleâ€”he has strong arms, from the warehouse,
and on sunday when they take the bus to emerald meadows he doesn't say:
"what will your chastity amount to when your flesh withers in a little while?"
no,
on sunday, when they picnic in emerald meadows they look at the sunday paper:
girl slays banker-betrayer
they spread it around on the grass
bath-tub stirs jersey row
and then they sit down on it, nice.
harry doesn't say "ziggin's ointment for withered flesh,
cures thousands of men and women of moles, warts, red veins, flabby throat, scalp and hair diseases,
not expensive, and fully guaranteed."
no,
harry says nothing at all,
he smiles,
and they kiss in the emerald meadows on the sunday paper.
