you watch the night like a material
slowly being crammed into a tube of rooms;
it showers into gunshot, pepper, dew,
as if a hand had squeezed it at one end,
is blank as innocence when daylight comes
projecting sunlit patches on the wall
that fade. too much is going on, too much
of life, you say, for you to live alone
on top of an old tenement, on a train
that might start off sometime, but never does.
your view is gone. turn around, and boom!,
a park appears between two fixed ideas
whose narrow aperture of sky in time
will house the slums of 1989 . . .
now new york is feigning its gray dark
london winter. invisible uptown
is out there somewhere, raining on its own.
palmed in the dusty pane, a circle bares
a scene that seems reprinted from the past:
a man with a dog is walking very fast
along a path among the stunted trees
of the little square below. he disappears.
