the flowerets look edible before they open,
like columns of sugar dots on tiny strips
i bought as a child. hard to bite the candy without
some paper adhering, as adding machine tape will
to large, red numbers. lilacs are like that: another year
unspools without major accomplishment,
while i question "major" and "accomplishment."
and when i find in costco those clusters
of pointillist pastel, i hope they will become
someone else's nostalgiaâ€”honorable emotion
propelling ulysses toward ithaca, and a woman
to set lilacs in her dooryard as her mother did.
