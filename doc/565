i found you
on gothtrash.com
and saved your picture
to my computer desktop
it gives me the feeling 
of something terrible
and familiar
a space
between lives
like seeing marcel
seeing gilberte
for the first time
how the fact of life itself
becomes a thing
languished and melancholy
i think i would like to lie
among southern magnolias
in snowfall
dark skies above
into which
i will never enter
i'm watching maya deren
maybe i will smoke weed
i called out sick
it's the afternoon
