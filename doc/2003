three people come where no people belong any more.
they are a woman who would be young
and good-looking if these now seemed
real qualities, a child with yellow hair, a man
hardened in desperate humanity. but here are only
dry cistern, adobe flaking, a lizard. and now this
disagreeable feeling that they were summoned. sun
on the corrugated roof is a horse treading,
a horse with wide wings and heavy hoofs. the lizard
is splayed head down on the wall, pulsing. they do not
bother to lift their binoculars to the shimmering distance.
from this dead center the desert spirals away,
traveling outward and inward, pulsing. summoned
from half across the world, from snow and rock,
from chaos, they arrived a moment ago, they thought,
in perfect fortuity. there is a presence emerging here in
sun dance and clicking metal, where the lizard blinks
with eyes whetted for extinction; then swirling
outward again, outward and upward through the sky's
white-hot funnel. again and again among the dry
wailing voices of displaced yankee ghosts
this ranch is abandoned to terror and the sublime.
the man turns to the woman and child. he has never
said what he meant. they give him
the steady cool mercy of their unreproachful eyes.
