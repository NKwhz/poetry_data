i’m overcome
by the cruelty
of nature
no i mean
i’m with
it. and each
little capacity
it has
can’t be transferred
i mean
a spruce
can’t give
its oils to you
can it.
but that’s how
it grows
in the ab
sence of
technology
my thoughts
grow. my thoughts
grow among
trees
but i don’t
help them
though
i’m for them.
i’m for my
dog & inci
dentally
i feed
her but i
don’t see
her much.
joe does.
joe is
my friend
& also
a dog father
i don’t
help mountains
mountains
help me
i know
the planet
is old
& splashy
sleep helps
me. time
helps
me. my mother
helped
me. and
now she
is gone. she
also hurt
me so it’s
good that
she’s gone.
i can grow
different
in the
day or
three decades
in which
i’ve got
left
i can
grow toward
the mountains
sit in solidarity
with prisoners
or go
to jail. i’m not joking
i can
push different.
i want
to say
something
about my cunt.
because
that’s
what you
ask. but
i am
alone. no
mother
no phone
just a notebook
& a cunt
& my thoughts.
i don’t
even think
my thoughts.
you do.
