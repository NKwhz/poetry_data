my name is alice elizabeth, so am i
allie sheedy of the movie short circuits thus angry
or elizabeth mcgovern self-controlled?
this question is posited
on a television screen where i can't quite identify
the actress shown—which is she?
i am allie and i will continue to rant.

hardwood says, you should stand up soon

i say, i'm using my period, to get pissed off and to know.

i dreamed, last night, about an immense dead seal
below the surface of the water in a harbor
pull the curtain down.
for months you would not break the spell
for eternities you have not done so, citing economic
exigencies; the whole thing is a mess.
i might rather be dead
than doing what it takes to keep the seal under water
whale-sized
e is for seal. for spell. for suppression.

the dead seal isn't a person, it's poetry the seal
the hallmark
of selfhood, dead grotesquely large and richly hardening.
"hardwood it was someone like you
you drowned the seal"
"no i'm making both you and it 'hard.' "

money's more the real live poetry
abstract symbolic imaginary
trade your life for it and trade it for your life
so you'll have something 'to do'
sink the whale
and sleep all day in the real world, up and functioning
more fully imagined and dreamed, in society's
than in your own, imagination?
i'm standing
i'm standing up hard
i keep being hardwood myself, dark and hard.

tell me something beautiful, bitter

so i don't have to be cloyed.
... soul's waters are reticent
sly swamps.
                       it had nothing in it,
that swamp; because i didn't know how to look for
the parts of its obvious whole—death is
minute, flavorful parts—which are said to spin
as i'm said to walk, moving while else
mostly unconscious of that.
