by any measure, it was endless
             winter. emulsions with
then circled the lake like
this is it. this april will be
inadequate sensitivity to green. i rose
early, erased for an hour
             silk-brush and ax
i'd like to think i'm a different person
             latent image fading
around the edges and ears
             overall a tighter face
now. is it so hard for you to understand
from the drop-down menu
in a cluster of eight poems, i selected
sleep, but could not
             i decided to change everything
composed entirely of stills
             or fade into the trees
but could not
             remember the dream
save for one brief shot
of a woman opening her eyes
ari, pick up. i'm a different person
in a perfect world, this would be
             april, or an associated concept
green to the touch
             several feet away
