dear sister,
 
america.
 
late nights, we lie under the spread and listen
to the stereo jazz sounds of wtko
on the fm station. he says i am so fine
in my tight, pulled-back and strapless
bed-sheet gown. imagine, the polyester
with sequins. a sultry dinah washington.
 
turn.     he puts a pillow on his stomach,
a finger to his lips and blows â€”
he can do a louis like nobody else.
turn,     to the golden oldies.
sometimes, he calls me his favorite supreme
or his one and only apollo showgirl.
 
with the switch of a dial, we move in unison.
in the infinite dark, our flickering stations    turn.
