oblong, its jutted ends rounding into circles,
the old sunken basin lies with its flat, marble lip
an inch below the terrace tiles.
over the stagnant water
slide reflections:
the blue-green of coned yews;
the purple and red of trailing fuchsias
dripping out of marble urns;
bright squares of sky
ribbed by the wake of a swimming beetle.
through the blue-bronze water
wavers the pale uncertainty of a shadow.
an arm flashes through the reflections,
a breast is outlined with leaves.
outstretched in the quiet water
the statue of a goddess slumbers.
but when autumn comes
the beech leaves cover her with a golden counter-pane.
