what happens to a dream deferred?
      does it dry up
      like a raisin in the sun?
      or fester like a sore—
      and then run?
      does it stink like rotten meat?
      or crust and sugar over—
      like a syrupy sweet?
      maybe it just sags
      like a heavy load.
      or does it explode?
