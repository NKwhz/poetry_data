in the long, sleepless watches of the night,
   a gentle face — the face of one long dead —
   looks at me from the wall, where round its head
   the night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
here in this room she died; and soul more white
   never through martyrdom of fire was led
   to its repose; nor can in books be read
   the legend of a life more benedight.
there is a mountain in the distant west
   that, sun-defying, in its deep ravines
   displays a cross of snow upon its side.
such is the cross i wear upon my breast
   these eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
   and seasons, changeless since the day she died.
