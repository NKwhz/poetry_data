no, i am not deformed.
i wear these socks
because i haven't any gloves,
and my fingers are bitten with frost.
they feel like stumps.
luckily, i finished covering
the citrus tree with sheets of burlap.
before darkness,
i will light a smudge pot
near the mummified trunk,
then anoint my hands in a blue salve.
yesterday was cold
but the freeze is on now.
i must remind myself
not to lick any cars.
mr. nishizawa, a house over,
told me his nephew
lost a fourth of his tongue
for that reason. years ago,
the rosebushes were ruined to a freeze
and have never come back.
if needed, i will stay up all night
and pray, will let the hoarfrost
burn in my chest. my grandfather
ate the yield from this tree
after he died. i saw him.
