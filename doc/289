there is the lightning-white moment
when i learn—
 
the way my costive train to krakow
stopped
 
and i woke to find myself,
in jostling twilight,
 
at the auschwitz platform—
that the italian postcard
 
i garnered in milan years ago
as a genial talisman
 
isn’t of a pipe-dreaming
italian boy,
 
no, no, but an androgynous
image of sophie scholl,
 
the young, intrepid resistance heroine—
as if i’d registered,
 
in my schubert-adoring daughter,
my school-resisting son,
 
a fire undetected before:
doric-strong nouns demanding
 
what would you undertake
to stop tyranny?—
 
stouthearted nouns:
integrity, probity, courage;
 
in benighted munich,
the spit-in-the-eye swiftness,
 
the unbossed bloom
of a crossed-out swastika,
 
the fierce integrity
in the gust of the word freedom
 
sprayed over the walls
and ramparts of a deranged
 
fatherland that rent flesh
as if it were foolscap—
 
someday you will be
where i am now,
 
a steely, premonitory sophie
proclaimed to the rapacious
 
nazi tribunal that rushed her
to execution—
 
gazer, collector, in clarity’s name,
look close, then closer:
 
it’s not just a bud-sweet,
pensive beauty,
 
a bel ragazzo’s charm;
all these years:
 
it’s the spirit of crusading youth
that i’ve cherished.
