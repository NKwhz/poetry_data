australia. phillip island. the tasman sea.
dusk. the craggy coastline at low tide in fog.
two thousand tourists milling in the stands
as one by one, and then in groups, the fairy penguins
mass up on the sand like so much sea wrack and
debris. and then, as on command, the improbable
parade begins: all day they've been out fishing
for their chicks, and now, somehow, they find them
squawking in their burrows in the dunes, one by one,
two by two, such comical solemnity, as wobbling by
they catch our eager eyes until we're squawking, too,
in english, french, and japanese, yiddish and swahili,
like some happy wedding party brought to tears   
by whatever in the ceremony repairs the rifts
between us. the rain stops. the fog lifts. stars.
and we go home, less hungry, satisfied, to friends
and family, regurgitating all we've heard and seen.
