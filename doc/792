we keep trying to kill it, split it, hack
it to itsy bits. we suspend it
on the wall where we can see it
passing. we hang it around our necks
or wrists, laying pulse next to
pulse as if each might like
company. ba-bump, etc. rising
and setting has everything to do
with it. in the afternoon we feel so
lazy we try not to close our eyes
and jerk awake, wondering what has
passed, and where did we go
for that suspended hour,
and could anything keep us here.
