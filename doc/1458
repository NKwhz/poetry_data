we stop at the dry cleaners and the grocery store   
and the gas station and the green market and   
hurry up honey, i say, hurry,   
as she runs along two or three steps behind me   
her blue jacket unzipped and her socks rolled down.   
where do i want her to hurry to? to her grave?   
to mine? where one day she might stand all grown?   
today, when all the errands are finally done, i say to her,   
honey i'm sorry i keep saying hurryâ€”   
you walk ahead of me. you be the mother.   
and, hurry up, she says, over her shoulder, looking   
back at me, laughing. hurry up now darling, she says,   
hurry, hurry, taking the house keys from my hands.
