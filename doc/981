i tried to cut through
                            all our hurried centuries,
                                                        lost in a forest within.
 
 
men
                            broke by war
                                                        emerged in frightful shape—
 
 
more than human
                            but also less,
                                                        they were quite aware,
 
 
the sovereign dead,
                            that time is like a window
                                                        opening up the sad patterns of never.
 
 
as one they advanced—

adolph hitler
                            —through history.
                                                        but the past does not follow
 
 
so straightforward a path
                            said i
                                                        (predictably in italian),
 
 
and, burning
                            under their masters,
                                                        they proclaimed
 
 
the world a pendulum.
                            it is possible,
                                                        but this gives rise
 
 
to the often-heard complaint
                            that repetition is unavoidable.
                                                        still time issues into today,
 
 
little fathers.
                            the years, i believe,
                                                        can be shaped with one’s hands.
 
 
the world
                            —its obscure moving fields,
                                                        persian tragedies,
 
 
and countries in peace—
                            i had to inform
                                                        that council of the lost,
 
 
remains an instrument,
                            a valve instrument,
                                                        which, when waning,
 
 
is perfectly clear in the pit
                            —and, being given
                                                        to such classical concepts
 
 
as freedom and necessity,
                            laboriously continued
                                                        in the traditional way—
 
 
i believe     i believe.
