stick that bumbershoot
in elephant’s-foot
brolly stand behind
the big door. mind
your manners at high tea.
hi, you. high ve-
locity hailstones cream
passersby beyond the panes. i dream
of jeannie, starring bar-
bara eden, of eden, star-
ring eve and adam, of adam
cartwright, a.k.a. the let-'em-
have-it-with-all-candor
trapper john. pander
to the mass-man mass-taste,
that’s my motto. waste
the day, the life, the villain
with depression, fill-in-
the-wrong-blanks misap-
prehension, dum-dums. nap
an hour through the buddy
ebsen as a perspicacious fuddy-
duddy whodunit. then produce
the silver teapot, loose
earl grey and table water
slabs. somebody’s daughter
carries on the grand tradition
in the grandma manner. wishin’
you were here don’t place you
in the old wing chair. face you
in the photos, china, art
on parlor walls. it’s raining in my heart.
