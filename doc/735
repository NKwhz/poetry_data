i looked up from my writing,
   and gave a start to see,
as if rapt in my inditing,
   the moon's full gaze on me.
her meditative misty head
   was spectral in its air,
and i involuntarily said,
   'what are you doing there?'
'oh, i've been scanning pond and hole
   and waterway hereabout
for the body of one with a sunken soul
   who has put his life-light out.
'did you hear his frenzied tattle?
   it was sorrow for his son
who is slain in brutish battle,
   though he has injured none.
'and now i am curious to look
   into the blinkered mind
of one who wants to write a book
   in a world of such a kind.'
her temper overwrought me,
   and i edged to shun her view,
for i felt assured she thought me
   one who should drown him too.
