i hardly know where to look
anymore. places have a
putrid familiarity
like the smell of my own sheets
or the close air of the kitchen â€”
fishbones on the drain
left in the ghastly order
of temporal things.
i have been sitting in this bar
for years now
the beer is stale, the wine off-color
the music is always the same,
old, sad songs that get older
no better than endless conversation
night after forgotten night
when all i or you can recall
is the dark, the traffic lights,
the bartender's comments
about drunk women
in public places.
i would like to go home
finally, down the long streets
north and south crossed with small gold leaves;
i forget just where the hell
anything is. locked out.
