blurring the window, the snowflakes' numb white lanterns.   
she's brewed her coffee, in the bathroom sprays cologne   
and sets her lipstick upright on the sink.   
the door ajar, i glimpse the yellow slip,   
the rose-colored birthmark on her shoulder.   
then she's dressedâ€”the pillbox hat and ersatz fur,   
and i'm dressed too, mummified in stocking cap   
and scarves, and i walk her to the bus stop   
where she'll leave me for my own walk to school,   
where she'll board the bus that zigzags to st. paul   
as i watch her at the window, the paperback   
romance already open on her lap,   
the bus laboring off into snow, her good-bye kiss   
still startling my cheek with lipstick trace.
