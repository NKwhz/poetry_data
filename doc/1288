she minces squid and a marinated scallion,
mixes rice with shrimp and olive paste. . . .
hope for the english meal, though half italian
with her jet black hair and her elastic waist.
unlike the other television cooks,
she brings to life a lobster that was dead
with common spices, her exotic looks,
and recipes she dreamed about in bed.
