you've heard me, scornful, harsh, and discontented, 
   mocking and loathing war: you've asked me why 
of my old, silly sweetness i've repentedâ€” 
   my ecstasies changed to an ugly cry. 
you are aware that once i sought the grail, 
   riding in armour bright, serene and strong; 
and it was told that through my infant wail 
   there rose immortal semblances of song. 
but now i've said good-bye to galahad, 
   and am no more the knight of dreams and show: 
for lust and senseless hatred make me glad, 
   and my killed friends are with me where i go. 
wound for red wound i burn to smite their wrongs; 
and there is absolution in my songs.
