look in my face; my name is might-have-been;
i am also call'd no-more, too-late, farewell;
unto thine ear i hold the dead-sea shell
cast up thy life's foam-fretted feet between;
unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen
which had life's form and love's, but by my spell
is now a shaken shadow intolerable,
of ultimate things unutter'd the frail screen.
mark me, how still i am! but should there dart
one moment through thy soul the soft surprise
of that wing'd peace which lulls the breath of sighs,â€”
then shalt thou see me smile, and turn apart
thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart
sleepless with cold commemorative eyes.
