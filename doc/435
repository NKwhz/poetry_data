some teeth down there
some hair and gray
gums
 
some grass and dirt
down there some gristle
and whimpers
 
all stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade
 
i had a dog
i had three dogs
i sit and stay
 
they did not disappear into
the trees one day
 
their brains were not broken coral on the street
they were meat
 
•
 
some leash
down there some shit
and tennis balls
 
i had a dog
i had three dogs
i sit and beg
 
their brains were not broken coral on the street
 
they were not meat
one day they did not disappear
into the trees
 
all stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade
 
some whimpers
down there some nipples
and pink tum-tums
 
•
 
some biting tails
down there some sunlight
and long nails
 
some fleas dug up some mange and gray tongues
 
i had a dog
they were meat
i had three dogs
 
they did not disappear into the streets
they did not tree
 
some haunch skid
and drag down there some
mouths one day
 
they did not smell like baby’s breath
 
all stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade
 
•
 
some grass and dirt
down there some teeth and
ruined carpets
 
i had a dog
i had three dogs
i fucked fleas
 
all stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade
 
some eyelashes
down there some eating grass
and mange some
baby’s breath
 
one day their brains were not broken
coral on the street
 
they did not disappear into the trees
 
•
 
some sit and stay
down there some meat
and sunlight
 
their brains were not
broken coral on the street they
did not disappear into
the trees
 
they did not fuck fleas
 
all stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade
 
some bones and baby’s breath down there
some bark and seizures
 
distant watery eyes
 
one day i had a dog
 
i had three dogs
