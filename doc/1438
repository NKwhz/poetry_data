paris in the spring, autumn in new york,
singers pair a city with a season
as though it belonged to it all year long.
they should try to put a few more to work:
trenton in winter needs a good reason;
scranton in summer seems so very wrong.
how about cincinnati in the spring?
autumn in passaic, or in oakland?
some cities just lack glamour and appeal,
and there is no point arguing the thing.
no one reads through stacks of brochures to spend
a honeymoon in allentown. letâ€™s get real.
most places on the map, you must believe,
no one wants to visit, only to leave.
