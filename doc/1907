i was looking for your hair,
black as old lava on an island   
of white coral. i dreamed it   
deserted you and came for me,   
wrapped me in its funeral ribbons   
and tied me a bow of salt.
here’s where i put my demise:   
desiring fire in a web of tide,   
marrying the smell of wet ashes   
to the sweet desert of your slate.
my intelligent mammal, male
of my species, twin sun to a world   
not of my making, you reduce me   
to the syrup of the moon, you boil   
my bones in the absence of hands.
where is your skin, parting me?
where is the cowlick under your kiss   
teasing into purple valleys? where   
are your wings, the imaginary tail
and its exercise? where would i breed   
you? in the neck of my secret heart   
where you’ll go to the warmth of me   
biting into that bread where crumbs crack   
and scatter and feed us our souls;
if only you were a stone i could   
throw, if only i could have you.
