let the musicians begin,
let every instrument awaken and instruct us
in love’s willing river and love’s dear discipline:
we wait, silent, in consent and in the penance
of patience, awaiting the serene exaltation
which is the liberation and conclusion of expiation.
now may the chief musician say:
“lust and emulation have dwelt amoung us
like barbarous kings: have conquered us:
have inhabited our hearts: devoured and ravished
—with the savage greed and avarice of fire—
the substance of pity and compassion.”
now may all the players play:
“the river of the morning, the morning of the river
flow out of the splendor of the tenderness of surrender.”
now may the chief musician say:
“nothing is more important than summer.”
and now the entire choir shall chant:
“how often the astonished heart,
beholding the laurel,
remembers the dead,
and the enchanted absolute,
snow’s kingdom, sleep’s dominion.”
then shall the chief musician declare:
“the phoenix is the meaning of the fruit,
until the dream is knowledge and knowledge is a dream.”
and then, once again, the entire choir shall cry, in passionate unity,
singing and celebrating love and love’s victory,
ascending and descending the heights of assent, climbing and chanting triumphantly:
before the morning was, you were:
before the snow shone,
and the light sang, and the stone,
abiding, rode the fullness or endured the emptiness,
you were: you were alone.
