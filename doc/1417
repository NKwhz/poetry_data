i'm herdsman of a flock.
the sheep are my thoughts
and my thoughts are all sensations.
i think with my eyes and my ears
and my hands and feet
and nostrils and mouth.
to think a flower is to see and smell it.
to eat a fruit is to sense its savor.
and that is why, when i feel sad,
in a day of heat, because of so much joy
and lay me down in the grass to rest
and close my sun-warmed eyes,
i feel my whole body relaxed in reality
and know the whole truth and am happy.
