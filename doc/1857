thanksgiving day i like to see
our cook perform her witchery.
she turns a pumpkin into pie
as easily as you or i
can wave a hand or wink an eye.
she takes leftover bread and muffin
and changes them to turkey stuffin’.
she changes cranberries to sauce
and meats to stews and stews to broths;
and when she mixes gingerbread
it turns into a man instead
with frosting collar ’round his throat
and raisin buttons down his coat.
oh, some like magic made by wands,
   and some read magic out of books,
and some like fairy spells and charms
   but i like magic made by cooks!
