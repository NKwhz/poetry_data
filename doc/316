i wake in a dark flat
to the soft roar of the world.
pigeons neck on the white
roofs as i draw the curtains
and look out over london
rain-fresh in the morning light.
 
this is our element, the bright
reason on which we rely
for the long-term solutions.
the orators yap, and guns
go off in a back street;
but the faith doesn’t die
 
that in our time these things
will amaze the literate children
in their non-sectarian schools
and the dark places be
ablaze with love and poetry
when the power of good prevails.
 
what middle-class shits we are
to imagine for one second
that our privileged ideals
are divine wisdom, and the dim
forms that kneel at noon
in the city not ourselves.

i am going home by sea
for the first time in years.
somebody thumbs a guitar
on the dark deck, while a gull
dreams at the masthead,
the moon-splashed waves exult.
 
at dawn the ship trembles, turns
in a wide arc to back
shuddering up the grey lough
past lightship and buoy,
slipway and dry dock
where a naked bulb burns;
 
and i step ashore in a fine rain
to a city so changed
by five years of war
i scarcely recognize
the places i grew up in,
the faces that try to explain.
 
but the hills are still the same
grey-blue above belfast.
perhaps if i’d stayed behind
and lived it bomb by bomb
i might have grown up at last
and learnt what is meant by home.
