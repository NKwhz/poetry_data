the fork lived with the knife
     and found it hard — for years
took nicks and scratches,
     not to mention cuts.
 
she who took tedium by the ears:
     nonforthcoming pickles,
defiant stretched-out lettuce,
     sauce-gooed particles.
 
he who came down whack.
his conversation, even, edged.
 
lying beside him in the drawer
     she formed a crazy patina.
the seasons stacked —
     melons, succeeded by cured pork.
 
he dulled; he was a dull knife,
while she was, after all, a fork.
