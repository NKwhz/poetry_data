that bag you packed me
when you sent me
to the universe—
camp after camp i’ve opened it
debating whether to unpack—
        not yet, not yet—
why did i feel so much in it
was dangerous on the playground,
too good for everyday,
feel those splendid fireworks
hazardous to institutions,
unmannerly to etiquette,
so that, time after time,
i found myself saying
       not yet?
 
at each new place i faced it,
it suggested,
here spread out your things,
put on this coat,
open this bottle—
       no, not yet . . .
sometimes throwing something out,
giving things away,
lightening my load. . . .
 
the more i pull out,
the more it seems, some days,
is left inside,
the heavier it is.
 
sometimes i think this package
is almost a door
the opening of which
careening across heaven
could be fatal.
 
some days now i wonder if i’ll ever
dare face my given garments—
permanently wrinkled,
surely out of date—
your travel-thought
wasting in its tissue, flesh-corrupt—
till i’ve absorbed it,
like those stitches that dissolve
in an incision
where something’s been removed.
