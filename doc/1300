time only cause of my unrest
by whom i hop’d once to bee blest
    how cruell art thou turned?
that first gav’st lyfe unto my love,
and still a pleasure nott to move
    or change though ever burned;
have i thee slack’d, or left undun
one loving rite, and soe have wunn
    thy rage or bitter changing?
that now noe minutes i shall see,
wherein i may least happy bee
    thy favors soe estranging.
blame thy self, and nott my folly,
time gave time butt to bee holly;
    true love such ends best loveth
unworhty love doth seeke for ends
a worthy love butt worth pretends
    nor other thoughts itt proveth:
then stay thy swiftnes cruell time,
and lett mee once more blessed clime
    to joy, that i may prayse thee:
lett mee pleasure sweetly tasting
joy in love, and faith nott wasting
    and on fames wings i’le rayse thee:
never shall thy glory dying
bee untill thine owne untying
    that time noe longer liveth;
t’is a gaine such tyme to lend:
since soe thy fame shall never end
    butt joy for what she giveth.
