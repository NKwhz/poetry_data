here is where
you can get nowhere
faster than ever
as you go under
deeper and deeper
in the fertile smother
of another acre
like any other
you can’t peer over
and then another
and everywhere
you veer or hare
there you are
farther and farther
afield than before
but on you blunder
in the verdant meander
as if   the answer
to looking for cover
were to bewilder
your inner minotaur
and near and far were
neither here nor there
and where you are
is where you were
