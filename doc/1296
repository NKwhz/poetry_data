i am unable to jump more than ten feet in the air.
i am blind. i am unable to understand the dark
passages. i begin to speak of being deprived.
i believe that i am being kept in want. who
governs me? who is to say what i am,
and what i am not? i wish to be conscious
of myself. my frontiers are long and insecure.
i contract them. i cannot command them.
i determine myself not to desire what is
unattainable. i have a wound in my leg.
i am a schoolboy. a rule does not oppress me
if i impose it on myself. i assimilate it
into my substance. i can never be thwarted.
i cannot want it to be other than it is.
