tell me not (sweet) i am unkind,
         that from the nunnery
of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
         to war and arms i fly.
true, a new mistress now i chase,
         the first foe in the field;
and with a stronger faith embrace
         a sword, a horse, a shield.
yet this inconstancy is such
         as you too shall adore;
i could not love thee (dear) so much,
         lovâ€™d i not honour more.
