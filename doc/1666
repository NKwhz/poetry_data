my first day leading the prison writing workshop: carlos
complimented my choosing the chair nearest the door.
i read a poem by whitman that once sent me hitchhiking
and carlos stood up, asked to read a section from his four hundred-page work-in-progress,
a poem that turns on his first finding neruda's "one year walk";
he said it lit up the night like a perfect crime, so i left everything—
i had no choice—walked three thousand miles to the pacific.
from memory he recited a passage in which his father left the family
a small fortune, all counterfeit: though i doubted the facts, i can still see
that worn briefcase, almost-perfect hundreds stacked neatly in shrink-wrapped packs.
i was young, it took me two weeks to accept that i could teach this lifer
nothing. world of concrete floors and everlasting light:
he was grateful to god who gave him a blazing mind not granted to anyone living or dead,
and wouldn't have changed a word anyway.
