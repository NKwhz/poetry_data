momentarily
 
                           the language of description is lost
 
        what you see with your eyes is enough, for you, anyway
 
but how to get the sense of what you saw across
 
                                                                              to another person
 
it’s possible
 
                      through the spirit in your voice
 
        when you say
 
                                         “it was great!”
 
to convey
 
                            what happened
 
                                            in that moment
 
      & it was great
 
                                        not only that
 
                              it was terrific, & interesting too
                  
                                                                              it was nice
 
            & i had a good time doing it. i had fun.
