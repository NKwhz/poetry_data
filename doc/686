then it was always
for now, later
for later.
and then years of now
passed, and it grew later
and later. trapped
in the shrinking
chocolate box
the confused sardine
was unhappy. it
leapt, and banged its head
again. and afterward
they said shall we
repeat the experiment.
and it said
later for that.
