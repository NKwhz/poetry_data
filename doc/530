september is work to the center
of arguments and controversies.
prejudgments and incomprehensions.
what will i love if not that
that was enigma?
the years of infancy, memory says,
and there we are, with the demon
of the art of living
traced on the glass of some window.
in the beauty of the night of may,
clear of moon, to the lume of a candle
there was a design like the profile
of a landscape almost abandoned. gone
but not gone yet. it's fascinating,
these mysterious uncovered feelings.
enigma of an afternoon of autumn, the picture
of which is a composition
of the eye of my mind. every hour
that i watch this picture
i see again still that moment.
nevertheless the moment is an enigma
for me, in how much is inexplicable.
the physical things hide in the architecture
of the event. the enigma of a mock-up,
of a shadow, the spectral and eternal aspect
of the moment. praises to you for being
one great box of surprise,
your head the scene of a wonderful theater
of the most tender gray of the fog
that joins the sky to the earth.
a tangling of truth and memory,
mythology and iconography,
i watch with the eye
of the mind the city that accommodates
that one beautiful day that is now infinite.
it deepens. it begins. the cyclical method.
memory is deeply not alive; it's a mock-up
and this renders it hateful. yet, it is not a fiction,
is a truth, indeed a sad and monstrous truth.
i was assigned to you, together we were
a beautiful and melancholic picture.
this last picture is the realization
of the overwhelming moment
in which the acute eye perceives you as a now
that is over. a now that is fixed
in the swept past.
