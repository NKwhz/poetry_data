i am done smoking cigarettes, done waiting tables, done counting tips
at two a.m. in the neon-dark dance hall, done sleeping with young men
in my apartment, done facing them or not, thinking of oblivion, which
is better than nothing. i am done not wearing underwear because
it’s so victorian. i am done telling men i don’t wear underwear because
it’s so victorian. i am done with the night a guy spread my legs
on a pool table, all those balls piled up in the pockets. i am done.
i am never going back. when i see that night on the street i will
drive past and never even glance over. i am done going to grad school,
nodding in your workshop. i am done teaching english as a second
language, saying i pointing to my chest, saying you pointing to them.
i am done teaching the poetry class where no one talked and no one
listened to me and outside the window the cottonwood wagged
its sun-white leaves in the breeze as if to say, i give up, i give up. i am done
being a childless woman, a childless wife, a woman with no scars
on her body. i am done with the wide afternoons of before, the long
stare, the tightly closed door. and i am done, too, for the most part,
with the daydream of after. i am after for now. i am turning up the heater
to see if that will make the baby sleep another fifteen minutes
so i can finish this poem. i am done thinking of the past as if it had
survived, though sometimes i think of the past and sometimes i see it
coming, catching up, hands caked with dried mud, head shaved clean.
