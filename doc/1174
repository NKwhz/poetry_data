the wind dying, i find a city deserted, except for crowds of
people moving and standing.
 
 
    those standing resemble stories, like stones, coal from the
death of plants, bricks in the shape of teeth.
 
 
    i begin now to write down all the places i have not beenâ€”
starting with the most distant.
 
 
    i build houses that i will not inhabit.
