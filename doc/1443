we have not long to love.
light does not stay.
the tender things are those
we fold away.
coarse fabrics are the ones
for common wear.
in silence i have watched you
comb your hair.
intimate the silence,
dim and warm.
i could but did not, reach
to touch your arm.
i could, but do not, break
that which is still.
(almost the faintest whisper
would be shrill.)
so moments pass as though
they wished to stay.
we have not long to love.
a night. a day....
