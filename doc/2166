the dance shoes, seduction
and coercion, owned by male feet,
roam floors that beg for chandeliers.
in search of flat-footed beauty
and a bed, where ever they might be,
the handsome conversation attracts
female followers trading on the smiles
of curves. the next steps are dizzying
and leave dresses dipped and hung over
with a purse and heart opened at
their tops. the wallflowers can't say
when the tango with the rag doll began,
but witnesses toasted a conga line
of would-be brides that transcend
a retirement community in florida,
each giving up their precious moments
on earth to fandango's flimflam.
