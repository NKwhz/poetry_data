careening over the
highway in
my lightweight
japanese
death star
buffeted by the great and powerful
winds
 
icy winds
of winter warming
cold air with hot air
under it
 
accordion pleats
of natural disaster
my disaster
 
in the past if you were to say to me
 
or to rage at me
in a poem
about america i would charge you
a great failure
 
to even use the word. it is
banality
this land is suffering because poets—
 
their great cohort—
 
 
i look twice
to save lives.
