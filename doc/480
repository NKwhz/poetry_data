the sensual sap ascends
to summer us, and all
fronds, greenwoods, lily bands
attend our festival.
a festival i had
more chaste and regular
when with the greening globe
i seasonally bore
my clocked and colored joys.
now, love, i stand exile
in the shadow of your praise,
errant, unpunctual.
