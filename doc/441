in the new century,
we lose the art of many things.
 
for example, at the beep, i communicate
using the wrong machine.
 
i called to say we have two lives
and only one of them is real.
 
when the phone rings: you could be anybody.
in the evening: you are homeless
 
and hunting for good light, as safe a place
as any to make a bed for the night.
 
in both my lives, my nerves go bust.
i’m certain that i’m not
 
as i appear, that i’m a figment and
you’re not really here.
 
the struggle
is authenticity.
 
i have a message.
you must believe me.
