out of me unworthy and unknown
the vibrations of deathless music;
“with malice toward none, with charity for all.”
out of me the forgiveness of millions toward millions,
and the beneficent face of a nation
shining with justice and truth.
i am anne rutledge who sleep beneath these weeds,
beloved in life of abraham lincoln,
wedded to him, not through union,
but through separation.
bloom forever, o republic,
from the dust of my bosom!
