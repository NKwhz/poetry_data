on fourteenth street the bugles blow,
   bugles blow, bugles blow.
the red, red, red, red banner floats
where sweating angels split their throats,
marching in burlap petticoats,
   blow, bugles, blow.
god is a ten car bronx express,
   red eyes round, red eyes round.
"oh where is my lustful lamb tonight,
his hair slicked down and his trousers tight?
i'll grind him back to my glory light!"
   roll, subway, roll.
heaven is a free amusement park,
   big gold dome, big gold dome.
movies at night: "the life she led."
everyone sleeps in one big bed.
the stars go around inside your head.
   home, sweet home.
on fourteenth street the bugles blow,
   bugles blow, bugles blow,
the torpid stones and pavements wake,
a million men and street-cars quake
in time with angel breasts that shake,
   blow, bugles, blow!
