what a thing it would be, if we all could fly.
but to rise on air does not make you a bird.
i’m sick of the hiss of champagne bubbles.
it’s spring, and everyone’s got something to puke.
the things we puke: flights of stairs,
a skyscraper soaring from the gut,
the bills blow by on the april breeze
followed by flurries of razor blades in may.
it’s true, a free life is made of words.
you can crumple it, toss it in the trash,
or fold it between the bodies of angels, attaining
a permanent address in the sky.
the postman hands you your flight of birds
persisting in the original shape of wind.
whether they’re winging toward the scissors’ v
or printed and plastered on every wall
or bound and trussed, bamboo frames wound with wire
or sentenced to death by fire
you are, first
and always, ash.
broken wire, a hurricane at each end.
fire trucks scream across the earth.
but this blaze is a thing of the air.
raise your glass higher, toss it up and away.
few know this kind of dizzy glee:
an empty sky, a pair of burning wings.
