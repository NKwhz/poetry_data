cleanse me of my iniquity
and wash away my sins.
laugh, lord, at my obliquity.
in you laughter begins.
regard this little steeple.
you gave to the high plains
a flock of sheep, the people
who drink deep when it rains.
i shall number all the stones
assyria has laid low.
i shall number all my bones
as david did long ago.
oh, what a troubled route man took,
descending from the trees:
cave paintings and the printed book
made on his bended knees.
lord, the broken spirit,
the sorrows in my heart
are much, much to inherit
and hard, hard to impart.
