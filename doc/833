the challenge: to start
not with theory but with tangible performance
you and others, approaching
we shall be asked for a way out
                to be fed
                to keep warm and dry
starting with experience, magic
genuine science
more than once we have been lost
in a trackless wilderness
dwarfed and shadowed by mighty buildings
subway trains wild as elephants
one goes blindly back to oneâ€™s desk
these moments come, their dark
shadow
we glimpsed control
and more tragic waste
we entered with 40,000,000 warriors
with the dignity of cathedrals
the lake is upon you.
you have two canoes, your tent
the child has entered upon this desert
you have your axes
what, precisely, is your procedure?
