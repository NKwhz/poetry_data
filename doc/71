my doggy ate my essay.
he picked up all my mail.
he cleaned my dirty closet
and dusted with his tail.
 
he straightened out my posters
and swept my wooden floor.
my parents almost fainted
when he fixed my bedroom door.
 
i did not try to stop him.
he made my windows shine.
my room looked like a palace,
and my dresser smelled like pine.
 
he fluffed up every pillow.
he folded all my clothes.
he even cleaned my fish tank
with a toothbrush and a hose.
 
i thought it was amazing
to see him use a broom.
i’m glad he ate my essay
on “how to clean my room.”
