tightened jaw, i did not love.
flashback of myself  jerked about,
legs high above my head, men
laughing, i came to sea drifts,
movement and crashing. i found i am
not so far from god exploding.
gifting, a friend once said, is why we live.
seven storks still and white on a gold lake.
my lazy eye glances back to that original
split, myself  high above myself.
whiplashed into forgetting, i didn’t know
hours from minutes. i was hypervigilant for
catastrophes. my head raging then numb.
the early garden bare, and now,
shocked with sudden memory,
i return to changing sky hues,
blooms of lilac bursting along sidewalks.
lazy in the grass, i free myself of guilt,
imagine musicians in the park, us overcoming
ourselves. my eyes open before stars.
holy these leaves, these skies.
what is torn opens for the light.
