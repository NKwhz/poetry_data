i want to be sweet and clear and free, as half a line
of auden, or an episode of the powerpuff girls;
i want to be dew, and honest with mine,
like bob marley, or boesman the boer.
i want to swing and get it right
at the speed of pollock’s light,
i want to be deep like zulu,
tight like tamil,
and trust my sense of sanskrit true
with little shame for its will.
i want to dabble in the fields
ignorant of what i was doing,
rub myself on the ruins
with a self-induced disease
and gleefully lapse
the hope to be heard. i want to fix
my favourite english words
into the forty-fifth century—
haw, for instance, or luminary—
hiding them in a snatch of prose…
passed over in silence
like wittgenstein, no evidence
for myself or laura riding,
like bharathiyar going mad composing,
i want to dissolve into our language
printing too little for my age;
i want to be obscure but not leaden,
flippant if i feel like it, then
i don’t mind being called poetically shitty
in a note from manohar shetty,
writing into the time we’ve borrowed,
singing from our utter boredom;
i want to hold in me the heat of my combustion
and leave this sweat-smear as a resurrection:
i want to be sweet and clear and free,
insouciant, insufferable, just like me.
