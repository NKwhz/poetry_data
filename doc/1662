he was touched or he touched or   
she did and was, or they were   
and would. or the room could, its   
three doors, two windows or   
the house on a slant touching,   
touched by the drift down street, cars   
pressing quick or slowing. all along   
the town touched a river, the river   
the filth falling through it. what was clean—   
a source pure as rumor—a shore   
touching lake touched by wind above,   
and below, a spring. all touch blindly
further water. that blue touching   
blacker regions in the sea so weirdly   
solitary, each to under, to every   
sideways past deeper, where nowhere.
