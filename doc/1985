a woman stepped outside, crumbled
into a loose particulate, and, as the breeze
blew up from the east, she scattered: her handful
of heart, volcanic ash, spiraled the highway,
and five of her teeth slipped between
her neighbor's breasts; her neighbor
unbuttoned her blouse to scratch
at her suddenly red and luminous skin.
days passed. each day the sun distractedly
drifted from chair to chair; each night the stars,
old scatterbrains, they commiserated.
it didn't rain. strange, the granular woman
thought to herself: although i encompass
so much, i accomplish so little.
her car sparkled with her hair and bones;
her garden thrived. she tried to think:
why did this happen? what had i eaten?
why was i bothered?â€”those old hours,
spotted and exotic lizards, darted
the gravel, flicking through their colors
of skin as one flicks channels on a tv.
she couldn't catch a one. then, as a flock
of sparrows converging for the skull
of an oak, all her twittering dust,
her brain, bone, and the dangerous shreds
of her fingers clawed for the sky;
what an interesting cloud someone said.
