today the cloud shapes are terrifying,   
and i keep expecting some enormous   
black-and-white b-movie cyclops   
to appear at the edge of the horizon,
to come striding over the ocean   
and drag me from my kitchen   
to the deep cave that flickered   
into my young brain one saturday
at the baronet theater where i sat helpless   
between my older brothers, pumped up   
on candy and horror—that cave,
the litter of human bones
gnawed on and flung toward the entrance,   
i can smell their stench as clearly
as the bacon fat from breakfast. this   
is how it feels to lose it—
not sanity, i mean, but whatever it is   
that helps you get up in the morning
and actually leave the house
on those days when it seems like death
in his brown uniform
is cruising his panel truck
of packages through your neighborhood.   
i think of a friend’s voice
on her answering machine—
hi, i’m not here—
the morning of her funeral,   
the calls filling up the tape
and the mail still arriving,
and i feel as afraid as i was
after all those vampire movies   
when i’d come home and lie awake
all night, rigid in my bed,
unable to get up
even to pee because the undead   
were waiting underneath it;
if i so much as stuck a bare
foot out there in the unprotected air   
they’d grab me by the ankle and pull me   
under. and my parents said there was
nothing there, when i was older   
i would know better, and now   
they’re dead, and i’m older,   
and i know better.
