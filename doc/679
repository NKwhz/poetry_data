that's what misery is,
nothing to have at heart.
it is to have or nothing.
it is a thing to have,
a lion, an ox in his breast,
to feel it breathing there.
coraz√≥n, stout dog,
young ox, bow-legged bear,
he tastes its blood, not spit.
he is like a man
in the body of a violent beast.
its muscles are his own . . .
the lion sleeps in the sun.
its nose is on its paws.
it can kill a man.
