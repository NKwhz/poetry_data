1.
of the gardens of adonis, lydia, i love
most of all those fugitive roses
         that on the day they are born,
         that very day, must also die.
eternal, for them, the light of day:
they're born when the sun is already high
         and die before apollo's course
         across the visible sky is run.
we too, of our lives, must make one day:
we never know, my lydia, nor want
        to know of nights before or after
        the little while that we may last.
2.
to be great, be whole: nothing that's you
         should you exaggerate or exclude.
in each thing, be all. give all you are
         in the least you ever do.
the whole moon, because it rides so high,
         is reflected in each pool.
