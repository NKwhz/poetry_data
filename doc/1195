when i came to my motherâ€™s house
the day after she had died
it was already a museum of her
unfinished gestures. the mysteries
from the public library, due
in two weeks. the half-eaten square
of lasagna in the fridge.
the half-burned wreckage
of her last cigarette,
and one red swallow
of wine in a lipsticked
glass beside her chair.
finally, a blue bic
on a couple of downs
and acrosses left blank
in the sunday crossword,
which actually had the audacity
to look a little smug
at having, for once, won.
