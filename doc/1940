where you've fallen, you will stay.
in the whole universe this one
and only place is the sole place
which you have made your very own.
the country runs away from you.
house, mill, poplarâ€”every thing
is struggling with you here, as if
in nothingness mutating.
but now it's you who won't give up.
did we fleece you? you've grown rich.
did we blind you? you watch us still.
you bear witness without speech.
