i would not have gotten in this boat with you.
i would not
except
where else was there
at the dockâ€™s end
to go?
the water
was cold.
i would not have let you row the boat.
i could see
what kind of man you were.
i would not but
who was there to choose
between
you and me?
i would not have let you throw away the oars.
i knew what would happen next,
except
what else was there to do,
struggle
in a boat with a leak
over cold water?
