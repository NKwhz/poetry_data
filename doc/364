dropping napkins, corks, and non-compostables
into the trash, i see that friends have mistaken
my everyday chopsticks for disposables,
helpfully discarding them alongside inedibles:
pork bones, shrimp shells, bitter melon.
among napkins and corks, they do look compostable:
off-white, wooden, warped from continual
washing — no lacquer, no ornament. but anyone
who thinks these chopsticks are disposable
doesn’t live with chopsticks in the comfortable
way of a favorite robe, oversized, a bit broken.
thin paper napkins, plastic forks, and non-compostable
takeout boxes constitute the chopstick’s natural
habitat to many i hold dear. with family or alone,
i’ll maintain that chopsticks aren’t disposable,
but if i can make peace with the loss of utensils
when breaking bao with guests, i’ll be one of them,
not digging in the napkins and corks. compostable
chopsticks are the answer: everyday and disposable.
