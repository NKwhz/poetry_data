is the governor falling
from a great height?
arm in arm we fled the brassiere factory,
the motion-boat stayed on the shore!
i saw how round its bottom was
as you walked into southern france—
upon the light hair of an arm
cigar bands lay!
i kissed you then. oh is my bar
the insect of your will? the water rose,
but will the buffalo on
the nickel yet be still?
for how can windows hold out the light
in your eyes!
darling, we fled the brassiere factory
in forty-eight states,
arm in arm,
when human beings hung on us
and you had been arrested by the cloths
were used in making, and i said, “the goths
know such delight,” but still we fled, away
into a dinner atmosphere
from all we knew, and fall asleep this day.
o maintenance men, with cruel eyes,
then arm in arm we fled the listless factory!
the music changed your fingers’ ends to pearl,
i punched you, you foolish girl,
for thanks to the metronome we got out alive, in the air
where the sun filled us with cruelty!
there’s what to do
except despair, like pages! and laugh
like prawns, about the sea!
oh arm in arm we fled the industry
into an earth of banks
and foolish tanks, for what bare breasts might be.
