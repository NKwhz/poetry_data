fortune hath taken thee away, my love,
my life’s soul and my soul’s heaven above;
fortune hath taken thee away, my princess;
my only light and my true fancy’s mistress.
fortune hath taken all away from me,
fortune hath taken all by taking thee.
dead to all joy, i only live to woe,
so fortune now becomes my mortal foe.
in vain you eyes, you eyes do waste your tears,
in vain you sighs do smoke forth my despairs,
in vain you search the earth and heaven above,
in vain you search, for fortune rules in love.
thus now i leave my love in fortune’s hands,
thus now i leave my love in fortune’s bands,
and only love the sorrows due to me;
sorrow henceforth it shall my princess be.
i joy in this, that fortune conquers kings;
fortune that rules on earth and earthly things
hath taken my love in spite of cupid’s might;
so blind a dame did never cupid right.
with wisdom’s eyes had but blind cupid seen,
then had my love my love for ever been;
but love farewell; though fortune conquer thee,
no fortune base shall ever alter me.
