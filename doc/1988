any sky-bird sings,
ring, ring!
any church-chime rings,
dong ding!
any cannon says,
boom bang!
any whirlwind says,
whing whang!
the bell-buoy hums and roars,
ding dong!
and way down deep,
where fishes throng,
by davy jones' big deep?sea door,
shaking the ocean's flowery floor,
his door-bell booms
dong dong,
dong dong,
deep, deep down,
clang boom,
boom dong.
