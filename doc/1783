ay, beshrew you! by my fay,
these wanton clerks be nice alway!
avaunt, avaunt, my popinjay!
what, will ye do nothing but play?
tilly, vally, straw, let be i say!
gup, christian clout, gup, jack of the vale!
with mannerly margery milk and ale.
by god, ye be a pretty pode,
and i love you an whole cart-load.
straw, james foder, ye play the fode,
i am no hackney for your rod:
go watch a bull, your back is broad!
gup, christian clout, gup, jack of the vale!
with mannerly margery milk and ale.
ywis ye deal uncourteously;
what, would ye frumple me? now fy!
what, and ye shall be my pigesnye?
by christ, ye shall not, no hardely:
i will not be jap√®d bodily!
gup, christian clout, gup, jack of the vale!
with mannerly margery milk and ale.
walk forth your way, ye cost me nought;
now have i found that i have sought:
the best cheap flesh that i ever bought.
yet, for his love that all hath wrought,
wed me, or else i die for thought.
gup, christian clout, your breath is stale!
go, mannerly margery milk and ale!
gup, christian clout, gup, jack of the vale!
with mannerly margery milk and ale.
