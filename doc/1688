to me, one silly task is like another.
i bare the shambling tricks of lust and pride.   
this flesh will never give a child its mother,â€”
song, like a wing, tears through my breast, my side,   
and madness chooses out my voice again,   
again. i am the chosen no hand saves:   
the shrieking heaven lifted over men,   
not the dumb earth, wherein they set their graves.
