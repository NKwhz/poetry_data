if aught of oaten stop, or past'ral song,
may hope, chaste eve, to soothe thy modest ear,
like thy own solemn springs,
thy springs and dying gales,
o nymph reserved, while now the bright-haired sun
sits in yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts,
with brede ethereal wove,
o'erhang his wavy bed;
now air is hushed, save where the weak-ey'd bat
with short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing,
or where the beetle winds
his small but sullen horn
as oft he rises 'midst the twilight path
against the pilgrim, borne in heedless hum:
now teach me, maid composed,
to breathe some softened strain,
whose numbers stealing through thy dark'ning vale
may not unseemly with its stillness suit,
as musing slow, i hail
thy genial loved return.
for when thy folding star arising shows
his paly circlet, at his warning lamp
the fragrant hours, and elves
who slept in flowers the day,
and many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge
and sheds the fresh'ning dew, and lovelier still,
the pensive pleasures sweet
prepare thy shad'wy car.
then lead, calm votress, where some sheety lake
cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed pile
or upland fallows grey
reflect its last cool gleam.
but when chill blust'ring winds, or driving rain,
forbid my willing feet, be mine the hut
that from the mountain's side
views wilds, and swelling floods,
and hamlets brown, and dim-discovered spires,
and hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all
thy dewy fingers draw
the gradual dusky veil.
while spring shall pour his showers, as oft he wont,
and bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest eve;
while summer loves to sport
beneath thy ling'ring light;
while sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves;
or winter, yelling through the troublous air,
affrights thy shrinking train
and rudely rends thy robes;
so long, sure-found beneath the sylvan shed,
shall fancy, friendship, science, rose-lipp'd health,
thy gentlest influence own,
and hymn thy fav'rite name!
