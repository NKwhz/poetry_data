we wonder at our shifting capacities, keep
adding and striking skills
from the bottoms of our résumés
under constant revision
like the inscriptions on tombs
shared for generations
unnervingly up
to date
made nervous by our shift in capabilities, we write:
                                            i visited a country where kittens lay  dying
                                            under every bench, in every gutter, next to
                                            every  cigarette butt. one  made  me  weep.

                                            strays.  the   first   one   i   saw   i   adopted.
                                            what  could  it  mean?
                                                                          —posted by sarah. 6.18.06
