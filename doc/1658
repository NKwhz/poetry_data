born in a safe family
but a dangerous area, iraq,
i heard guns at a young age, so young
they made a decision to raise us safe
so packed our things
and went far away.
now, in the city of rain,
i try to forget my past,
but memories never fade.
this is my life,
it happened for a reason,
i happened for a reason.
