translation broadens language
as divorce and remarriage extend family.
born to fade and break, facts
huddle inside black brackets.
work means inquisition as a child
separates a cricketâ€™s wings from thorax.
ideas come apart as monads, metastasizing
rhapsody on the edge of delicate dusk.
thunder sounds in the distance or television,
always on in this constant rain.
