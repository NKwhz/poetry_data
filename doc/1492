the sprig of unknown bloom you sent last fall
spent the long winter drying on my wall,
mounted on black. but it had turned to fluff
some months ago. tonight i took it down
because i thought that i had had enough
of staring at it. brittle, dry and brown,
it seemed to speak too plainly of a waste
of friendship, forced to flower, culled in haste.
so, after months of fearing to walk past
in case the stir should scatter it to bits,
i took it out to scatter it at last
with my own breath, and so to call us quits.
â€”fooled! for the fluff was nothing but a sheath,
with tiny, perfect flowers underneath.
