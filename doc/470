the stones we have thrown i hear
fall, glass-clear through the year. in the valley
confused actions of the moment
fly howling from tree-top
to tree-top, quieting
in air thinner than now's, gliding
like swallows from mountain-top
to mountain-top till they
reach the furthest plateaus
along the edge of existence. where
all our deeds fall
glass-clear
to no ending
except ourselves.
