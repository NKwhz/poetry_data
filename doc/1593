it is old school custom to pretend to be sad
when we think about the early death of keats.
the species-truth of the matter is we are glad.
psilanthropic among exegetes,
i am so moved that when the plate comes by
i almost think to pay the god—but why?
when we think about the early death of keats
we are glad to be spared the bother of dying ourselves.
his poems are a candy store of bitter-sweets.
we munch whole flights of angels from his shelves
drooling a sticky glut, almost enough
to sicken us. but what delicious stuff!
the species-truth of the matter is we are glad
to have a death to munch on. truth to tell,
we are also glad to pretend it makes us sad.
when it comes to dying, keats did it so well
we thrill to the performance. safely here,
this side of the fallen curtain, we stand and cheer.
psilanthropic among exegetes,
as once in a miles-high turret spitting flame,
i watched boys flower through orange winding sheets
and shammed a mourning because it put a name
to a death i might have taken—which in a way
made me immortal for another day—
i was so moved that when the plate came by
i had my dollar in hand to give to death
but changed to a penny—enough for the old guy,
and almost enough saved to sweeten my breath
with a toast i will pledge to the ape of the divine
in thanks for every death that spares me mine.
i almost thought of paying the god—but why?
had the boy lived, he might have grown as dull
as tennyson. far better, i say, to die
and leave us a formed feeling. o beautiful,
pale, dying poet, fading as soft as rhyme,
the saddest music keeps the sweetest time.
