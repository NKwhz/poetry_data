i have nothing to recant, i am just
the decanter. you, the just destroyer,
have in faith become the role, recalling
for those gathered the noble fallen
with a prayer to his-grace-above-fire,
(“turn me, i’m burnt on that side”)
st. lawrence. well done, i applaud.
and you: well executed.
this is it. not much else to await
when our fates touch: i’ve nowhere to be
but eternity, you’ve nothing to catch
but the thatch. dry on dry,
we keep our wits about us . . .
no one to meet but our match.
