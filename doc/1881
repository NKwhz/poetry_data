’tis now since i began to die
four months, yet still i gasping live;
wrapp’d up in sorrow do i lie,
hoping, yet doubting a reprieve.
adam from paradise expell’d
just such a wretched being held.
’tis not thy love i fear to lose,
that will in spite of absence hold;
but ’tis the benefit and use
is lost, as in imprison’d gold:
which though the sum be ne’er so great,
enriches nothing but conceit.
what angry star then governs me
that i must feel a double smart,
prisoner to fate as well as thee;
kept from thy face, link’d to thy heart?
because my love all love excels,
must my grief have no parallels?
sapless and dead as winter here
i now remain, and all i see
copies of my wild state appear,
but i am their epitome.
love me no more, for i am grown
too dead and dull for thee to own.
