turning and turning in the widening gyre   
the falcon cannot hear the falconer;
things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
the blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
the ceremony of innocence is drowned;
the best lack all conviction, while the worst   
are full of passionate intensity.
surely some revelation is at hand;
surely the second coming is at hand.   
the second coming! hardly are those words out   
when a vast image out of spiritus mundi
troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   
a shape with lion body and the head of a man,   
a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   
the darkness drops again; but now i know   
that twenty centuries of stony sleep
were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   
and what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   
slouches towards bethlehem to be born?
