morn on her rosy couch awoke,
   enchantment led the hour,
and mirth and music drank the dews
   that freshen’d beauty’s flower,
then from her bower of deep delight,
   i heard a young girl sing,
‘oh, speak no ill of poetry,
   for ’tis a holy thing.’
the sun in noon-day heat rose high,
   and on the heaving breast,
i saw a weary pilgrim toil
   unpitied and unblest,
yet still in trembling measures flow’d
   forth from a broken string,
‘oh, speak no ill of poetry,
   for ’tis a holy thing.’
’twas night, and death the curtains drew,
   ’mid agony severe,
while there a willing spirit went
   home to a glorious sphere,
yet still it sigh’d, even when was spread
   the waiting angel’s wing,
‘oh, speak no ill of poetry,
   for ’tis a holy thing.’
