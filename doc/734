'o england, may god punish thee!'
— is it that teuton genius flowers
only to breathe malignity
upon its friend of earlier hours?
— we have eaten your bread, you have eaten ours,
we have loved your burgs, your pines' green moan,
fair rhine-stream, and its storied towers;
your shining souls of deathless dowers
have won us as they were our own:
we have nursed no dreams to shed your blood,
we have matched your might not rancorously
save a flushed few whose blatant mood
you heard and marked as well as we
to tongue not in their country's key;
but yet you cry with face aflame,
'o england, may god punish thee!'
and foul in onward history,
and present sight, your ancient name.
