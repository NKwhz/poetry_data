when you think about it, mostly, a cage is air —
so what is there
to be afraid of?
a cage of air. baudelaire said
poe thought america was one giant cage.
to the poet, a nation is one big cage?
and isn’t the nation mostly filled with air?
try to put a cage around your dream.
the cage escapes the dream.
i see it streak and stream.
