just one more vintage movie,
batwings tonight at the bal masqué —
another creature stuffed
by distinguished pedigree.
i get a lot of madcap ideas about sentience,
how knowing has you put down in the book
forbidden speech recognition —
else why make such a face?
and now it’s luck no longer mouth that moves
when fastidious rummage whispers
to divulge a surplus
a clue if not the key.
prospect my question laps up for good —
i lean to it. knowing you,
first-person dwindle.
tweet-tweet. prick.
