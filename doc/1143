no children;
cold uncoils in the blood;
science, true, not good
for you. so old,
suddenly, or so young.
lyric inside not to be sung.
plug pulled, screen gone.
sun out; mind
bountiful, playing pain.
these are my children
in my head. unbegotten.
this is to self-forget,
to have the future
born forgotten.
