crying, my little one, footsore and weary?
  fall asleep, pretty one, warm on my shoulder:
i must tramp on through the winter night dreary,
  while the snow falls on me colder and colder.
you are my one, and i have not another;
  sleep soft, my darling, my trouble and treasure;
sleep warm and soft in the arms of your mother,
  dreaming of pretty things, dreaming of pleasure.
