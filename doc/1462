the night never wants to end, to give itself over   
to light. so it traps itself in things: obsidian, crows.   
even on summer solstice, the day of light’s great   
triumph, where fields of sunflowers guzzle in the sun—   
we break open the watermelon and spit out   
black seeds, bits of night glistening on the grass.
