a garden
late spring, honeysuckle and lazy birds
heavy with the round scent
of tuberoses and jungle gardenia.
there is a man
in boots that make his thighs
look lethal   with a whip
no spurs
medieval sorrow in his eyes
or around the mouth, maybe.
he is dangerous
in this place he has
the fertility of steel.
there is a woman
in a vine green habit   her
veins are purple, her blue
eyes. she is blonde
though sometimes brunette:
     “my horse is lamed
       i was riding, i...”
and — still in the heavy air
they push each other down
like dogs with fleas
under the bushes, in them.
the camera pans to the nearest tree
the cat approaches like a panther.
she is also in boots
like an empress
who loves horses.
the man puts on spurs:
there is combat
     his knightly despair
     her deathly power.
the witch burns, finally —
the lamed horse returns.
                      love you,
                         lanita
