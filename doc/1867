there may be chaos still around the world,
this little world that in my thinking lies;
for mine own bosom is the paradise
where all my life’s fair visions are unfurled.
within my nature’s shell i slumber curled,
unmindful of the changing outer skies,
where now, perchance, some new-born eros flies,
or some old cronos from his throne is hurled.
i heed them not; or if the subtle night
haunt me with deities i never saw,
i soon mine eyelid’s drowsy curtain draw
to hide their myriad faces from my sight.
they threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
a happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.
