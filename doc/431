i shall never get you put together entirely,
pieced, glued, and properly jointed.
mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles
proceed from your great lips.
itâ€™s worse than a barnyard.
 
perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,
mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.
thirty years now i have labored
to dredge the silt from your throat.
i am none the wiser.
 
scaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of lysol
i crawl like an ant in mourning
over the weedy acres of your brow
to mend the immense skull plates and clear
the bald, white tumuli of your eyes.
 
a blue sky out of the oresteia
arches above us. o father, all by yourself
you are pithy and historical as the roman forum.
i open my lunch on a hill of black cypress.
your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered
 
in their old anarchy to the horizon-line.
it would take more than a lightning-stroke
to create such a ruin.
nights, i squat in the cornucopia
of your left ear, out of the wind,
 
counting the red stars and those of plum-color.
the sun rises under the pillar of your tongue.
my hours are married to shadow.
no longer do i listen for the scrape of a keel
on the blank stones of the landing.
