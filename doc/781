     were there again, thus they walked legless,
   noses thumbed at the sun. unlay’s avatar

     the honey we’d heard about i wanted to know...
      in the realm of whatsay it all bore consequence.
they did a slack-legged shuffle, legless though
   they were, quick-switch imbroglio the cost of it,

     inward step, my heart itself, closer than close
   could be. i had a go at it but fell, my legs were in

thought about walking. i had to think about walk-

  a new lady named ahdja joined our group,
    slight of limb, loose tomboy body, smile so
broad we blushed. the egyptian spring was
                                                                                up
      in smoke in back of us, we trudged on, far
  from all that, even far from lone coast, a
    former life stalked us it seemed... we took
                                                                                  tiny
steps, unsure what lay under us, unlay’s realm
    the sweet precinct we sought, unsure what
  would get us there... to say we was too much
                                                                                    my
      head told me. not so my second head said. to
  say we was all i wanted my third head said, sec-
    ond head said to’ve lost itself, third head always
                                                                                            at
      odds with itself, want wanting more of itself...
  it was ahdja’s dream we were in, the we i went
    on about, unlay’s adumbration. when would
                                                                                      its

    the we we’d eventually be, when would lay’s
day be done. it was my dream of ahdja we were
                                                                                        in

    walking. huff said, “i told you so,” and we kept
walking, unlay’s late promenade all there was
  left... i dreamt a dream of moving on, i dreamt

  unlay was no simple stand, this or that mystic
    hustle, this or that bodily rebuke. in the end
it will have been all there was we grew to expect,
                                                                                         no
      soul’s captivity some book had called egypt, a
  book we no longer read... in the realm of whatsay
    we tramped along, there no matter spun by the
                                                                                           swirl
of it, there no matter where we were. moment’s
    notice moment’s gnosis, the moment brought bad
  and good. ahdja’s ka was layla, itamar’s majnun,

     crew caught up in the old way, the old way’s day
  redone... “madness be our name,” we chimed in
    unison, incensed, majnun’s dream of a just world
just dreaming, majnun’s each and all we were. so
                                                                                           it

so it went, unlay unlike what it was we expected,
                                                                                          sanc-

      from inside we saw was what soul was. “this is how

    somehow. “this is how it is,” i said, “this is how it
is,” voice eaten at by the bay we stood in front of, cold

      salt... if not what wet our hems anointment was
nothing, nothing if not what tugged our feet. “froth be

                                                                                               in-

    was a core to be gotten to, cloth drawn aside or
  gone under, frills fallen away at the water’s edge...
