my eyes are on yours
looking for my body in the dark pools of your pupils
and my mind is in a dark suburban town
where the milkman delivers clanking bottles
to the homes of disenchanted gen xers. 
you label me an old soul but i digress.
i am the broken bones you find on a beach
on your lonely vacation, too worn down to
provide an exact time frame.
ageless.
i could have been lying dormant as
an existential crisis since the late seventies
when you made a suicide pact with the neighbor
you would never see again
or preceding the birth of the universe. 
buddhists say that there is a source of
and path out of suffering.
but they do not know, do not say
how to save yourself from a cycle of 
emotional disconnect, of perpetual floating
on the sands of time,
how to embrace introspectionâ€™s anchor
like a long-lost brother.
