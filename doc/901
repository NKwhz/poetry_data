why are the woods so alluring? a forest appears
to a young girl one morning as she combs
the dreams out of   her hair. the trees rustle
and whisper, shimmer and hiss. the forest
opens and closes, a door loose on its hinges,
banging in a strong wind. everything in the dim
kitchen: the basin, the jug, the skillet, the churn,
snickers scornfully. in this way a maiden
is driven toward the dangers of a forest,
but the forest is our subject, not this young girl.
she’s glad to lie down with trees towering all around.
a certain euphoria sets in. she feels molecular,
bedeviled, senses someone gently pulling her hair,
tingles with kisses she won’t receive for years.
three felled trees, a sort of chorus, narrate
her thoughts, or rather channel theirs through her,
or rather subject her to their peculiar verbal
restlessness ...    our deepening need for non-being intones
the largest and most decayed tree, mid-sentence.
i’m not one of you squeaks the shattered sapling,
blackened by lightning. their words become metallic
spangles shivering the air. will i forget the way home?
the third blurts. why do i feel like i’m hiding in a giant’s nostril?
the oldest prone pine wants to know. are we being   freed
from matter? the sapling asks. insects are well-intentioned,
offers the third tree, by way of consolation. will it grow
impossible to think a thought through to its end? gasps the sapling,
adding in a panicky voice, i’m becoming spongy! the girl
feels her hands attach to some distant body. she rises
to leave, relieved these trees are not talking about her.
