i try not to cast too much shade.
sin would be
to use the excuse
of her growth in my womb,
to imagine her as a limb of myself.
she is her own tree,
late-winterâ€™s indomitable shoot.
she takes cupfuls of sun.
i stand well clear
as the branches stretch
like flutes playing allegros.
not for anything
would i poison her
with an act of possession,
conceal her from the woodsman
whose task is to make room for all.
