i can play songs in my head
yes i can perfectly replicate
 
(the) full-on
orchestral
every note
(when the lights / do down / in the city)
yet i cannot
 
compose, for example
 
and though when i was young i believed
 
that the fullness meant
i could recreate the sounds
i heard in my head with my mouth
 
i learned through painful iteration
painfully unsatisfactory
 
shameful the rendition
 
so partial
almost unrelated
the qualities are: note tone scale register vocality musicality
incapacity
painfully shy of representation
is there anyone?
 
who is a record player
