weeks after ice-out,
last fall’s leaves
make a pathway
to the lake, radiant blue
and still deathly cold.
 
i press my hot forehead
to the window,
smudging it. blow
and the glass steams.
as if looking at a photo
through parchment,
i’m detached,
the way i saw his body
in the cat scan
from a foggy distance.
 
i’d like to open the window,
release a wounded bird
nursed to health.
wiping the glass
with my sleeve
i see white pelicans
wheel and flash in the sky.
