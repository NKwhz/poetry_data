the first time i write my full name
jacqueline amanda woodson
without anybody's help
on a clean white page in my composition notebook,
     i know
if i wanted to
i could write anything.
letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,
     becoming
thoughts outside my head
becoming sentences
written by
                                                  jacqueline amanda woodson
