a strong song tows
us, long earsick.
blind, we follow
rain slant, spray flick
to fields we do not know.
night, float us.
offshore wind, shout,
ask the sea
what’s lost, what’s left,
what horn sunk,
what crown adrift.
where we are who knows
of kings who sup
while day fails? who,
swinging his axe
to fell kings, guesses
where we go?
