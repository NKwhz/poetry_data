there is no escaping the storm of roses
crisscrossed on the split-cracked wall
of a dead fountain arch.
there is no escaping their uterine balls,
expanding as a reminder of the children i never had.
if you listen carefully you can hear the vibrations,
the heart drone of their petal jaw-harps.
and thereâ€™s no going back,
no indiscovery of mars
or these red planets brooding before me,
light predators, sun-hatched
and bloodening like the fists of women
who have gone to war.
