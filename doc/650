some folks fool themselves into believing,
but i know what i know once, at the height
of hopeless touching, my man and i hold
our breaths, certain we can stop time or maybe
eliminate it from our lives, which are shorter 
since we learned to make love for each other 
rather than doing it to each other. as for praise 
and worship, i prefer the latter. only memory
makes us kneel, silent and still. hear me? 
thunder scares. lightning lets us see. then, 
heads covered, we wait for rain. dear lord, 
let me watch for his arrival and hang my head
and shake it like a man who's lost and lived. 
something keeps trying, but i'm not killed yet.
