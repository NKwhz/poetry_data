this is a day when i covered no ground.
just pushed and shuffled my papers around,
nudged at letters and winced at bills,
sorting them out into different hills,
hunted fretfully for a ruler,
worried the overworked water cooler,
sharpened pencils and filled my pen,
then shuffled my papers around again.
