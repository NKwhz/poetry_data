if   i would be walking down the road
you told me to imagine and i would and find
a diner kind of   teacup sitting on its saucer
in the middle then i would feel so good
in my life that is just like mine
i would walk right up and look into my face
eclipsing the sky in the tea in the cup
and say, “thank you, i have enjoyed
imagining all this.”
