’tis to yourself i speak; you cannot know
him whom i call in speaking such an one,
for thou beneath the earth lie buried low,
which he alone as living walks upon;
thou mayst at times have heard him speak to you,
and often wished perchance that you were he;
and i must ever wish that it were true,
for then thou couldst hold fellowship with me;
but now thou hear’st us talk as strangers, met
above the room wherein thou liest abed;
a word perhaps loud spoken thou mayst get,
or hear our feet when heavily they tread;
but he who speaks, or him who’s spoken to,
must both remain as strangers still to you.
