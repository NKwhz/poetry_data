pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
i’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size   
but when i start to tell them,
they think i’m telling lies.
i say,
it’s in the reach of my arms,
the span of my hips,   
the stride of my step,   
the curl of my lips.   
i’m a woman
phenomenally.
phenomenal woman,   
that’s me.
i walk into a room
just as cool as you please,   
and to a man,
the fellows stand or
fall down on their knees.   
then they swarm around me,
a hive of honey bees.   
i say,
it’s the fire in my eyes,   
and the flash of my teeth,   
the swing in my waist,   
and the joy in my feet.   
i’m a woman
phenomenally.
phenomenal woman,
that’s me.
men themselves have wondered   
what they see in me.
they try so much
but they can’t touch
my inner mystery.
when i try to show them,   
they say they still can’t see.   
i say,
it’s in the arch of my back,   
the sun of my smile,
the ride of my breasts,
the grace of my style.
i’m a woman
phenomenally.
phenomenal woman,
that’s me.
now you understand
just why my head’s not bowed.   
i don’t shout or jump about
or have to talk real loud.   
when you see me passing,
it ought to make you proud.
i say,
it’s in the click of my heels,   
the bend of my hair,   
the palm of my hand,   
the need for my care.   
’cause i’m a woman
phenomenally.
phenomenal woman,
that’s me.
