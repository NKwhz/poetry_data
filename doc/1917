clownlike, happiest on your hands,   
feet to the stars, and moon-skulled,   
gilled like a fish. a common-sense   
thumbs-down on the dodo’s mode.   
wrapped up in yourself like a spool,   
trawling your dark as owls do.   
mute as a turnip from the fourth   
of july to all fools’ day,
o high-riser, my little loaf.
vague as fog and looked for like mail.   
farther off than australia.
bent-backed atlas, our traveled prawn.   
snug as a bud and at home   
like a sprat in a pickle jug.   
a creel of eels, all ripples.   
jumpy as a mexican bean.   
right, like a well-done sum.   
a clean slate, with your own face on.
