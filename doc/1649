the wild and wavy event
now chintz at the window
was revolution . . .
adams
to miss abigail smith:
you have faults
you hang your head down
like a bulrush
you read, you write, you think
but i drink madeira
to you
and you cross your leggs
while sitting.
(later:)
how are the children?
if in danger run to the woods.
evergreen o evergreen
how faithful are your branches.
