new york grows
slimmer
in his absence.
i suppose
you could also title this picture
of miles, his leathery
squint, the grace
in his fingers a sliver of the stuff
you canâ€™t get anymore,
as the rest of us wonder:
what was the name
of the driver
of that truck? and the rest
of us sigh:
death is one hell
of a pickpocket.
