imagine lucifer
an angel without angelness
an apple
plucked clear by will of taste, color,
strength, beauty, roundness, seed
absent of all god painted, present everything
an apple is.
imagine lucifer
an angel without angelness
a poem
that has revised itself out of sound
imagine, rhyme, concordance
absent of all god spoke of, present everything
a poem is.
                            the law i say, the law
is?
what is lucifer
an emperor with no clothes
no skin, no flesh, no heart
an emperor!
