it’s not paradise i’m looking for
but the naming i hardly gave a thought to.
call it the gift i carried in my loneliness
among the animals before i started
listening to the news. call it the hint
i had about the knowledge that would explode.
in the meantime, which is real time
plus the past, you’re swishing your skirt
and speaking french, which is more
than i can take, which i marvel at
like a boy from the most distant seat
in the kronos dome, where i am one
of so many now i see the point
of falling off. there’s not enough seats
for us all to attend the eschaton.
this ecstasy that plants beauty
on my tongue, so that if it were
a wing, i’d be flying with the quickness
of a hummingbird and grace of a heron,
is so much mercy in light of the darkness
that comes. who would say consolation?
who would say dross? not that anyone
would blame them. all night i hear
so many echoes in the forest i’m tempted
to look back, to save myself in hindsight,
where all i see is the absence of me.
where all i hear is your voice,
which couldn’t be more strange.
how to go on walking hand in hand
without our bodies on the path
we made for our feet, talking, talking?
