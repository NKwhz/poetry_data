the problems of a working girl
are more than meet the naked eye;
and life becomes a dizzy whirl
at times—and dizzy, too, am i.
i have not found the answer yet,
and this is just a working plan:
i shove along and do not fret,
nor yet depend on any man.
to be a mother and a wife,
i'm often urged by all my kith
and kin—but as for husbands, life
is easier without than with.
